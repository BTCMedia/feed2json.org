To help our readers stay up-to-date with Bitcoin, we're republishing the latest issue of this newsletter below. Remember <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/\">to subscribe</a> to receive this content straight to your inbox.</em></p><p>This week’s newsletter describes a discussion about rescuing lost LN funding transactions and includes our regular sections with announcements of releases, release candidates, and notable changes to popular Bitcoin infrastructure software.</p><h2>News</h2><ul><li><strong>Rescuing lost LN funding transactions:</strong> LN funding transactions are not safe in the presence of transaction malleability. Segwit eliminated third-party malleability as a concern for most transactions, but it doesn’t address the case where the creator of a transaction mutates its txid themselves, such as by fee bumping the funding transaction using <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/replace-by-fee/\">Replace-by-Fee</a> (RBF). If a txid mutation happens, then the pre-signed refund transaction is not valid, so the user can’t get their funds back. Additionally, the remote node may not automatically see the funding transaction and so may not be able to help the funder get their money back.This week, Rusty Russell <a href=\"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-March/002981.html\">posted</a> to the Lightning-Dev mailing list about a quick and experimental feature he implemented in C-Lightning to help a user with this problem recover their funds. He also described alternative solutions for related problems as well as the impact of the <a href=\"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/issues/851\">proposed</a> channel dual-funding protocol on this problem. Christian Decker also <a href=\"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-March/002982.html\">posted</a> a <a href=\"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/issues/854\">proposed change</a> to the LN specification to help facilitate funding recovery efforts. As LN software adds support for funding channels from external wallets (e.g. C-Lightning as described in <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2019/06/19/#c-lightning-2672\">Newsletter #51</a> and LND in <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2020/04/08/#lnd-4079\">Newsletter #92</a>), developers may want to give this type of failure scenarios more attention.</li></ul><h2>Releases and release candidates</h2><p><em>New releases and release candidates for popular Bitcoin infrastructure projects. Please consider upgrading to new releases or helping to test release candidates.</em></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/releases/tag/2.0.0\">HWI 2.0.0</a> is the release for the next major version of HWI. Among other improvements, it contains support for multisig on the BitBox02, improved documentation, and support for paying <code>OP_RETURN</code> outputs with a Trezor.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning/releases/tag/v0.0.13\">Rust-Lightning 0.0.13</a> is the latest release for this LN library containing improvements aimed at forward compatibility with <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/multipath-payments/\">multipath payments</a> and future script upgrades such as <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/taproot/\">taproot</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/releases/tag/v1.0.7.0\">BTCPay Server 1.0.7.0</a> is the latest release for this self-hosted payment processing software. Notable improvements include a more featureful and visually appealing wallet setup wizard, the ability to import wallets created using Specter, and more efficient QR codes for <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/bech32/\">bech32 addresses</a>.</li></ul><h2>Notable code and documentation changes</h2><p><em>Notable changes this week in <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\">Bitcoin Core</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning\">C-Lightning</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair\">Eclair</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/\">LND</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning\">Rust-Lightning</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1\">libsecp256k1</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI\">Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI)</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin\">Rust Bitcoin</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/\">BTCPay Server</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/\">Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/\">Lightning BOLTs</a>.</em></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21007\">Bitcoin Core #21007</a> adds a new <code>-daemonwait</code> configuration option. It has been possible to run Bitcoin Core as a background daemon process since early versions by starting the program with the <code>-daemon</code> configuration option. The <code>-daemon</code> option causes the program to immediately start the daemon process in the background. The new <code>-daemonwait</code> option is similar, but only puts the daemon process in the background after initialization is complete. This allows the user or parent process to more easily know whether the daemon started successfully by observing the program’s output or exit code.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/issues/4404\">C-Lightning #4404</a> allows the <code>keysend</code> RPC (see <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2020/07/22/#c-lightning-3792\">Newsletter #107</a>) to send messages even to nodes that don’t explicitly signal that they support the feature. As <a href=\"https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/issues/4299#issuecomment-781606865\">discussed</a>, the signal was never standardized and the procedure implemented by LND didn’t depend on signaling, so this change should allow C-Lightning to send to roughly the same set of nodes that LND can address.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/issues/4410\">C-Lightning #4410</a> brings the experimental implementation for dual-funded channels in line with the most recent <a href=\"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/issues/851\">draft specification</a> changes. Most notably, the use of Proof of Discrete Log Equivalency (PODLE) has been dropped, at least temporarily (see <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2020/02/05/#interactive-construction-of-ln-funding-transactions\">Newsletter #83</a> for original discussion of PODLEs and <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/01/13/#ln-dual-funding-anti-utxo-probing\">Newsletter #131</a> for discussion about alternatives). Subsequent to this merge, a <a href=\"https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/issues/4427\">new PR</a> was opened that will make experimenting with dual-funding more accessible by eliminating the need to compile C-Lightning with special build flags (although a special configuration option will still be required).</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/5083\">LND #5083</a> allows a <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/psbt/\">PSBT</a> to be read from a file rather than by reading the standard input (stdin) file descriptor. Some terminals have a <a href=\"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/5080\">limit</a> on the number of characters that can be added to stdin simultaneously (i.e. pasted), which made PSBTs over 4096 base64 characters (equivalent to 3.072 bytes of binary) unusable. Especially now that several hardware wallets require PSBTs include previous transactions for segwit spends (see <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2020/06/10/#fee-overpayment-attack-on-multi-input-segwit-transactions\">Newsletter #101</a>), it’s common to create PSBTs over 3 KiB in size.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/5033\">LND #5033</a> adds an <code>updatechanstatus</code> RPC that can advertise that a channel has been disabled (similar to your node going offline) or that it’s been re-enabled (similar to your node coming back online).</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning/issues/826\">Rust-Lightning #826</a> increases the maximum allowed <code>OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY</code> delay to 2,016 blocks for the output paying the node that is unilaterally closing the channel. This fixes an interoperability issue when opening channels with LND, which may request a delay up to 2016 blocks, larger than the previous Rust-Lightning maximum of 1008 blocks.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/issues/488\">HWI #488</a> implements a breaking change in how the <code>displayaddress</code> command handles multisig addresses when used with the <code>--desc</code> option for <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/output-script-descriptors/\">output script descriptors</a>. Previously, HWI applied <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0067.mediawiki\">BIP67</a> lexicographic key sorting automatically based on what the device involved used (e.g. applying BIP67 for Coldcard devices, not applying it for Trezor devices). The way this was implemented created problems when the user explicitly specified the <code>sortedmulti</code> descriptor option that implements BIP67 key sorting. After this change, users of descriptors need to specify <code>sortedmulti</code> for devices that require lexicographic key sorting or <code>multi</code> for those that don’t.</li></ul>","summary":"This week’s Bitcoin Optech newsletter describes discussion on rescuing lost Lightning Network funding transactions, announcements of releases and release candidates, and notable changes to popular Bitcoin infrastructure software.","date_published":"2021-03-17T16:05:27.000Z","author":{"name":"Bitcoin Optech"}},{"guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-a-cult-phenomenon","url":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-a-cult-phenomenon","title":"Bitcoin: A Cult Phenomenon","content_html":"<p class=\"subtitle\">Though the term “cult” has a negative connotation, adherence to the Bitcoin ideology is about changing the world for the better.</p><!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>According to Tim Draper, an American venture capital investor, Netflix <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/netflix-might-be-next-fortune-100-firm-to-buy-bitcoin-tim-draper\">will</a> be the next Fortune 100 company to buy bitcoin. Moreover, the billionaire believes that it’s only a matter of time before Amazon has little option but to accept the cryptocurrency for payments. This comes at a time when the likes of <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/why-does-microstrategy-continue-to-feverishly-accumulate-bitcoin\">MicroStrategy</a> and <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/its-happening-tesla-buys-1-5-billion-of-bitcoin\">Tesla</a> are moving parts of their corporate treasuries into Bitcoin. <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/paypal-to-acquire-digital-asset-custody-provider-curv\">PayPal</a> has been busy purchasing a technology firm called Curv, which engages in the secure storage of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin. </p><p>But these institutions are only entering the game long after devoted believers laid the groundwork. This is not a criticism, it’s a fact. After all, Bitcoin needs the likes of Tesla and PayPal to get involved, otherwise any aspirations of becoming a global currency simply can’t be fully realized. These huge companies give the crypto sector a seal of approval it desperately needs, and it’s one of the reasons why Bitcoin has become so incredibly successful.</p><p>But what are some of the other reasons for the cryptocurrency’s success? </p><p>It’s decentralized in nature, it offers security and anonymity, it’s free from third party interference, etc. What I am asking, however, is this: What are the factors, at a human level, that make Bitcoin so desirable?</p><p>And not just desirable, but highly desirable. In fact, it’s no exaggeration to say that Bitcoin has a cult-like following. Why?</p><p>The word “cult” is most commonly used as a pejorative. It conjures up images of chaos and despair; names such as Charles Manson and Reverend Jim Jones instantly spring to mind. Irrational and dangerous. But, one wonders, can some cults be grounded in complete rationality?</p><p>What is a cult? <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1385935\">It’s simply</a> a deviant group which exists in a state of tension with society.</p><p>Across the world, there are thousands of cults. Some of them, of course, are very dangerous. Nevertheless, as researchers at Tennessee State University have <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=7b33d5df643842a8875ff9f675ce6ae2\">noted</a>, “a cult is simply a group or movement held together by a shared commitment to a charismatic leader or ideology.” It purports to have a “belief system that has the answers to all of life’s questions.” Furthermore, cults tend to offer a novel “solution to be gained only by following the leader’s rules.” Lastly, for a cult to be truly successful, it “requires a high level of commitment from at least some of the members.”</p><p>Manson had devoted followers, many of them young women. The ”Manson girls,” as they came to be known, were willing to do almost anything for the leader. Ideological loyalty and commitment to the group’s philosophies were essential. Charles Manson was clearly a dangerous criminal and his ideas were inherently racist.</p><p>What if another cult happens to have ideas that are both rational and economically sound and open to all people, regardless of sexual orientation, skin color, etc? What if the underlying ideology is, in fact, rooted in the idea of genuine unity? </p><p>In Christian doctrine, the Trinity consists of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit; a unity of sorts, three persons in one Godhead. </p><p>The doctrine of the Trinity <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Trinity-Christianity\">is</a> “considered to be one of the central Christian affirmations about God.” </p><p>Cults also tend to have their own Trinity-like doctrines. First, there’s differentiation; second, there’s the promotion of a lifestyle; and third, there is the promise of liberation from oppressive forces. </p><p>Bitcoin, like Apple and Tesla, is truly different. Although thousands of cryptocurrencies exist, bitcoin is a blue whale in a sea of anchovies. It was the world’s first ever cryptocurrency; the world’s first ever “digital gold.” Again, like Apple and Tesla (as well as Ikea and Harley Davidson), Bitcoin promotes a certain lifestyle, one free from banking constraints and third-party intermediaries. Essentially, it promotes a lifestyle based on a greater degree of financial autonomy. Lastly, though it might sound extreme, Bitcoin does appear to offer genuine liberation. </p><p>Currently, around the world, one billion people are either unbanked or underbanked; bitcoin offers many of these people a credible alternative. By allowing financial exchanges within an easily-accessible network, the need for centralized financial institutions disappears. Such a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, decentralized in nature, is designed with the people in mind. </p><p>Cults consist of deviants, people who wear the badge of nonconformity with a degree of honor. Considering the combined worth of all cryptocurrencies accounts for about 0.7 percent of the world's money, bitcoiners are most definitely deviants, at least from a financial perspective.</p><p>Though the term “cult” suggests something sinister, context is incredibly important. If the underlying ideology is based on sound principles, then, strict adherence to the ideology appears to be rational. Again, the term “ideology” carries its own share of negative connotations (for obvious, historically-significant reasons). Yet, the word merely denotes a system of ideas and ideals. Some ideas and ideals are abhorrent; others, meanwhile, change the world for the better.</p><p>Bitcoin aims to do the latter.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by J. Mac Ghlionn.

Remember to start with small amounts of bitcoin until these concepts make more sense and you are comfortable putting your funds in a mobile wallet. And always backup your seed phrase!</p><h2>Step One: Install Blue Wallet</h2><p>Blue Wallet installs just like any other app on your iPhone. Navigate to your Apple App store app and select download. Check Blue Wallet's<a href=\"https://bluewallet.io/\"> website</a> for more details.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjYzOTYyOTA2ODMwNjY2/bw-download.png\" height=\"400\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>If prompted, enter your Apple ID password.

Advanced settings allow users to utilize more features, like adding entropy (randomness) to their seeds with dice rolls or coin flips, to set up wallets for different Bitcoin address types and more.</p><p>To enable advanced options, select the three-dot menu in the upper-righthand corner of the homescreen, then select \"General.\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjYzOTg3MDY2MDIxNzA2/img_0063_1.png\" height=\"1102\" width=\"620\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjYzOTk0ODUwNjQ5OTMw/img_0064.png\" height=\"1102\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>Then toggle the \"Advanced Mode\" slider and select the back arrow to return to the wallet homescreen.</p><p>From there, select \"Add a wallet.\"</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjY0MDA0MjQ1ODkwODkw/img_0065.png\" height=\"1102\" width=\"620\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjY0MDEzMzcyNjk2NTM2/img_0063.png\" height=\"1102\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>You can name your wallet anything that is convenient for you, I chose \"BW Demo\" for this example.</p><p>Then you can choose the kind of wallet that you would like to create. I chose a Bitcoin wallet for this example.</p><p>If you decided to enable the advanced options, you will notice that you can choose the address type for your new Bitcoin wallet. I recommend sticking with the BIP84 Bech32 native SegWit address type. These are the addresses that start with \"bc1\" and typically, they can save you on data space in your transactions which translate to less expensive miner fees.</p><p>Then, if you would like to provide your own entropy in your wallet seed, you can select \"Provide entropy via dice rolls\" and then you will be able to select various sided dice or you can flip coins to generate random numbers to include in the generation of your seed. This is not required, but it is a nice option to have.</p><p>Alternatively, select the blue \"Create\" button when you are ready to move on.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjY0MDIzNTczMjQzNzIy/img_0066.png\" height=\"1102\" width=\"620\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjY0MDMwODIxMDAxMDM0/img_0067.png\" height=\"1102\" width=\"620\"></figure><h2>Step Thee: Secure The Seed Phrase</h2><p>Note: This is the most important step.</p><ol><li>Write down your words in order on a piece of paper</li><li>Secure this piece of paper as though it were gold or jewelry</li><ol><li>Do not screen-shot these words</li><li>Do not save these words on a computer or on your phone</li><li>Do not say these words out loud</li><li>Never share these words with anyone for any reason</li><li>Your bitcoin is only as secure as your 12 words</li></ol><li>Double check your work then confirm acknowledgement that you have secured your 12 words</li><li>Select “OK, I wrote this down”</li></ol><p>Note: If you utilized the advanced option to provide your own entropy, then you should have 24 words to write down.

Be aware of the privacy implications when sharing your Bitcoin address; all transactions on the blockchain are available to the public, so it is a good idea to keep this information separate from your identity. </p><p>Once a payment transaction from your sender is broadcast to the network, you should see the pending receipt in your wallet within moments. Your transaction will remain in a \"pending\" state until it has a certain number of confirmations. Each confirmation means that an additional block has been added to the Bitcoin blockchain after the block that contains your transaction. Typically, it is recommended to allow at least three to six block confirmations before trusting that your received funds are secure.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjY0MTA0MzcyMzE1OTc4/img_0073-1.png\" height=\"1102\" width=\"620\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjY0MTEwODE0NzY3MDY0/img_0074-1.png\" height=\"1102\" width=\"620\"></figure><h2>Step Five: Spend Bitcoin</h2><p>Once your received funds have been confirmed, a green deposit arrow will be displayed next to the transaction.

I only covered the iPhone application in this article. </p><p>Blue Wallet is packed with advanced features like user-provided entropy via dice rolls and coin toss, coin control, variable miners fees, duress wallet, and Lightning integration. But my favorite feature is the ability to handle partially-signed bitcoin transactions (PSBT). With PSBT, you can import your hardware wallet xpub and use Blue Wallet as a watch-only wallet. This allows you to monitor the balance on your hardware wallet while on the go as well as to generate receiving addresses for your hardware wallet. Watch-only wallets cannot spend from your hardware wallet, so your funds are always secure. </p><p>When you want to spend from your hardware wallet, you can enter the watch-only wallet in your Blue Wallet application, construct the spend transaction and then export it as a PSBT. Then you can load this PSBT into your hardware wallet via the MicroSD card option and sign the transaction with your hardware wallet’s private key. Once signed, the transaction can be passed back to your Blue Wallet and broadcast to the network.</p><p>You should now have a basic understanding of how to install Blue Wallet on your iPhone, how to secure your wallet’s 12-word seed phrase and how to receive/send bitcoin.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Econoalchemist.

The South African country has also become a popular hotbed for the digital currency market. In fact, it is considered by many to be the next frontier in Bitcoin.</p><p>According to the cryptocurrency exchange Paxful, South Africans recently traded more than<a href=\"https://paxful.com/buy/bitcoin/south-africa\"> $2.5 million</a> worth of bitcoin in a single month.</p><p>Technological literacy is quite widespread in Africa. And since Bitcoin is based on blockchain technology, it has triggered a lot of interest on the continent, especially among the youthful population. Per <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=bitcoin\">Google Trends data</a>, South Africa is ranked as fourth among all countries in the world for the frequency with which its citizens searched the keyword “Bitcoin” over the last year. Countries like Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya, in addition to South Africa, have also demonstrated massive interest in bitcoin. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-05/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-reconsiders-africa-travel-plan\">reportedly planning a visit to Africa</a> to explore crypto opportunities thanks to the widespread bitcoin adoption there.</p><p>The enthusiasm around ingenious technologies such as Bitcoin and blockchains has boosted adoption in South Africa. Many of the properties that make Bitcoin appealing in any place around the world can be listed as reasons why it is particularly popular in South Africa.</p><p>For instance, it is easy to access the peer-to-peer marketplace and cryptocurrency exchanges there. Using these platforms can be more simple and straightforward than opening and operating a bank account. Some of the popular bitcoin exchanges in South Africa include VALR and Luno.</p><p>Also, Bitcoin is decentralized and transverses all borders. This makes it an efficient payment method. And, besides enabling payment transactions, bitcoin is considered a wealth storage asset. In other words, investors classify the digital currency together with precious metals such as gold when it comes to storing value. This versatility feature endears bitcoin to many investors, including South Africans</p><h2>The Volatility Of The Rand</h2><p>But there are some conditions specific to South Africa that make Bitcoin appealing to those who live there.</p><p>The South African rand is, according to <a href=\"https://www.compareforexbrokers.co.za/\">forex brokers operating in South Africa</a>, considered one of the world's most-traded currencies in the world with high volatility tendencies. For instance, in March 2020, the rand’s <a href=\"https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/rand-volatility-heads-for-uncharted-territory-as-risks-stack-up\">volatility reached its highest</a> mark since the 2008 financial crisis. The negative swing of the fiat currency sent shivers down the spines of investors. As a result, many investors moved to use bitcoin to shield their wealth against a sharp fall in prices.</p><p>Volatility weakens local currencies, leading to dollar scarcity and making bitcoin a preferred alternative for transactions. High demand for bitcoin due to weak fiat currency boosts its adoption. Here is another point: <a href=\"https://african.business/2020/03/finance-services/cryptocurrencies-in-africa-a-coming-money-revolution/\">Government failure in South Africa has also boosted cryptocurrency adoption</a> as investors use bitcoin to hedge against political risks.</p><h2>Favorable Money Transfer Costs</h2><p>Besides accessibility problems, processing transactions through banks in African countries is often a slow and costly experience. Additionally, you must provide personal information, including the date, your name, your date of birth and your home address. The complex bureaucracy makes the money transfer process very complicated.</p><p>Bitcoin transactions, on the other hand, are quick and much cheaper. Deposits, withdrawals and other transactions often do not require as many personal details. Aside from being cheaper, bitcoin transactions are also more convenient methods of transferring value. This makes bitcoin an appealing alternative to fiat currency, growing its adoption significantly. </p><h2>Impact of Government Regulations </h2><p>Initially, there were no regulations governing bitcoin adoption in South Africa. However, the government <a href=\"https://www.mondaq.com/india/fin-tech/1044546/global-cryptocurrency-regulatory-landscape\">has put anti-money laundering (AML) regulations into place</a>. </p><p>The South African Reserve Bank is in the process of allowing the private sector to experiment with cryptocurrency use cases under regulatory supervision. However, the institution likely wants to be careful and conservative with approving bitcoin activity, like other regulatory bodies doubtlessly are. A significant goal is to prevent people from channeling money out of the country through encrypted and anonymous transactions.</p><p>That notwithstanding, the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is still not adequately regulated in South Africa to protect newcomers, meaning there would be no recourse if you lost your money due to a bad actor.</p><h2>Final Words</h2><p>Bitcoin adoption has grown significantly around the world in the recent past. Some of the major causes of the growth include emerging cryptocurrency markets, major fiat currency fluctuation and the development of financial infrastructure. While the most-known African country for bitcoin adoption is <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-bitcoin-has-been-so-successful-in-nigeria\">Nigeria</a>, <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/ukraine-russia-south-africa-nigeria-cryptocurrency-adoption/\">South Africans are far from idle </a>when it comes to their adoption of BTC. </p><p>Going forward, wider access to education and the internet will unlock the full potential of bitcoin in the country. Bitcoin will deliver on its promise as a new class of asset, giving investors more power through their portfolios without the need to rely on intermediaries.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Michael.

And Remember to start with small amounts of bitcoin until these concepts make more sense and you are comfortable putting your funds in a mobile wallet. And always backup your seed phrase!</p><h2>Step One: Install Samourai Wallet</h2><p>Samourai Wallet can be downloaded from its<a href=\"https://samouraiwallet.com/download\"> website</a> or<a href=\"https://samouraiwallet.com/download/fdroid\"> F-Droid</a>,<a href=\"https://code.samourai.io/wallet/samourai-wallet-android/-/tree/master\"> compiled</a> from source code or installed directly on your Android device from <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samourai.wallet\">Google Play Store</a>.</p><p>For the simplistic and basic purposes of this guide, I'm only going to cover the installation instructions from <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samourai.wallet\">Google Play Store</a>.

This allows for QR code scanning. Then, Allow read/write permission for the app and OS. This allows the encrypted backup file to be saved.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjQwNTAyMTg0ODQ2NDE1/screenshot_20210206-114939.png\" height=\"1309\" width=\"620\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjQwNTEzOTk2MDA2NTM3/screenshot_20210206-114948.png\" height=\"1309\" width=\"620\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjQwNTI2MDc1NjAyMDU3/screenshot_20210206-114959.png\" height=\"1309\" width=\"620\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjQwNTM2NTQ0NTg0Nzgz/screenshot_20210206-115006.png\" height=\"1309\" width=\"620\"></figure><h2>Step Three: Enable Tor</h2><p>Make sure you enable Tor by moving the slider to the right. Wait for the confirmation, this allows app communication over Tor.</p><p>Note: If you have a<a href=\"https://ronindojo.io/\"> Dojo</a>, this is the step at which you would connect it. Keep in mind that, although running your own node is an advanced topic, it is highly recommended that you learn about it. If you do not use your own node, then you are trusting someone else's node. There are many full node implementations available. This goes beyond the scope of this article but for some good resources, check<a href=\"https://bitcoiner.guide/node/\"> here</a>. </p><p>After enabling Tor, Select “START NEW WALLET.” Once installed, your Samourai Wallet will save an encrypted backup file to your Android device.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjQwNTUyNjUwNzEyMjAx/screenshot_20210206-115014_1.png\" height=\"1309\" width=\"620\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjQwNTYwNzAzNzc1ODgx/screenshot_20210206-115046.png\" height=\"1309\" width=\"620\"></figure><h2>Step Four: Create A Passphrase And PIN</h2><p>Next, you will be asked to create a passphrase. This is the passphrase that encrypts your backup file and your wallet's BIP39 passphrase, also known as your \"thirteenth word.\" Any combination of numbers, letters and special characters is acceptable. I suggest trying to use a high-entropy password that cannot be guessed, such as one from a random password generator. Others may suggest using a passphrase that can be easily memorized. Weigh the tradeoffs for yourself and do what is best for you. Whatever you choose, remember that this passphrase will be necessary to recover your wallet in the event that your mobile phone is lost, damaged or replaced. Confirm acknowledgement that no one can help you recover this passphrase, then select “Next.”</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjQwNTcyNTE0OTM1ODg3/screenshot_20210206-115054.png\" height=\"1309\" width=\"620\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjQwNTgxMzczMzA1OTM1/screenshot_20210206-115432.png\" height=\"1309\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>Next, create a PIN code for accessing the app. If someone were to gain access to your Android phone, then this PIN code will protect your wallet. Any combination of numbers between five and eight digits will work. Try to use a PIN that cannot be guessed. Once entered, you will be asked to confirm the PIN code. Then select “Next.”</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjQwNTk0Nzk1MDc4Nzkz/screenshot_20210206-115443.png\" height=\"1309\" width=\"620\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjQwNjAxNTA1OTY1MTM1/screenshot_20210206-115455.png\" height=\"1309\" width=\"620\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjQwNjEyNzgwMjU0MzQ1/img_20210206_120520.jpg\" height=\"1296\" width=\"620\"></figure><h2>Step Five: Secure the Seed Phrase</h2><p>Note: This is the most important step.</p><ol><li> Write down your words in order on a piece of paper</li><li> Secure this piece of paper as if it were gold or jewelry</li><li>Do not screenshot these words.</li><li>Do not save these words on a computer or on your phone</li><li>Do not say these words out loud</li><li>Never share these words with anyone for any reason</li><li>Your bitcoin is only as secure as your 12-words and passphrase.</li><li>Double check your work, then confirm acknowledgement that you have secured your 12 words</li><li>Select “RETURN TO WALLET”</li><li>You will also need your passphrase from above for a complete secure backup</li></ol><p>It's a good idea to use the recovery worksheet provided by Samourai Wallet, it has all of the necessary fields specifically for your Samourai Wallet to fill in and help you keep your backup information organized.

In addition, he is a member of Tesla’s board. This means that he either was in support of the decision for Tesla to purchase $1.5 billion of BTC, or at least was in the room to hear the arguments made to convince the majority of the board to go through with the decision. Given that Oracle creates computer software company products, its board and executive team are likely to be technologically savvy; therefore increasing the likelihood that they would understand why Bitcoin is so valuable as an inflation hedge asset. </p><p>Oracle reported its earnings recently and it did not disclose that it had made a BTC treasury allocation. But if it were to do so soon, this would have an immense effect on the price, and due to game theory, the speed at which corporations move to take their own respective positions in bitcoin would also be affected as well. </p><p>It is interesting to note that the price has been increasing steadily over the last 24 hours. This could be completely coincidental, but there’s a possibility that market participants are speculating, or have insider knowledge of, a major announcement. In the days prior to Tesla’s announcement of its $1.5 billion purchase, there was a steady increase in price, possibly from insider knowledge of the ensuing announcement. </p><p>Regardless, on February 8, when it did make the announcement, biitcoin had a $7,500 daily candle, a roughly 20 percent increase.

What comes next, nobody knows.</p><!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>The Bitcoin black hole has absorbed $1 trillion of monetary energy in only 12 years. As the legacy financial system nears the event horizon, BTC's gravitational pull grows stronger. Quadrillions of dollars of monetary energy will soon be compressed into 21 million bitcoin — the singularity. What comes out on the other side of the wormhole, nobody knows.</p><p>Many Bitcoiners believe this will take place, but have you actually run the numbers? It is impossible to know exactly how this will unfold, but by running some of the numbers we can get a better understanding of how dramatic this event will be. The math in this article is truly mind boggling. </p><p>To begin, it is important to understand that over 88 percent of all bitcoin that will ever exist have already been put out into supply. Through subsidy halvings, the flow of new coins being introduced into circulation via mining is cut in half every four years. The most recent supply halving was in May 2020, and will occur again sometime in 2024. With that being said, those roughly 18.6 million coins (that have already been created) <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-market-cap-breaks-1-trillion-as-btc-price-surges-again\">have absorbed $1 trillion of monetary energy</a>. Many of these coins have either been lost or moved into cold storage, never to resurface. As demand for bitcoin exponentially increases, the entire legacy financial system will need to be condensed into the remainder of coins that are available to be bought. </p><p>According to Glassnode, there are roughly 2.4 million coins currently up for sale on exchanges.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjIzMDg0NzUwMjgzODU1/glassnode-studio_bitcoin-balance-on-exchanges-1.png\" height=\"349\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>The entire global financial system will need to be condensed into those coins, in addition to the final 2.4 million coins to be created over time between now and the year 2140.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjIwNzQyNjUwOTMwMjU1/pasted-image-0-1.png\" height=\"275\" width=\"620\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-clock/\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>There is roughly $2.1 quadrillion of monetary energy in the world, a number that is drastically increasing. If hyperbitcoinization were to occur right now, this $2.1 quadrillion must be compressed into the 2.4 million bitcoin left on exchanges. Quadrillions are massive numbers that no one can reasonably wrap their head around, so let’s break this down to some smaller examples:</p><p><em>Disclosure: These numbers change as price rises, but the price at the time of this writing, used for these calculations, was $57,000. </em></p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is currently capitalized at $31.6 trillion or, in bitcoin terms, 554,385,964 BTC!</p><p>The entire fixed-income market is currently capitalized at roughly $129 trillion or, in bitcoin terms, 2,263,157,000 BTC!</p><p>The entire global real estate market is estimated to be worth $380 trillion or, in bitcoin terms, 6.6 billion BTC. </p><p>In total, between just the S&amp;P 500, fixed-income and real estate markets, they are all capitalized at a whopping 9.354 billion BTC. As mentioned, there are only 2.4 million bitcoin left to be bought on exchanges. </p><p>Phrased another way, 9.354 billion-bitcoin-worth of monetary energy must be compressed into the mere 2.4 million bitcoin up for sale.</p><p>If Apple was to step in right now and put merely 5 percent of its cash ($9.55 billion) into bitcoin, it would buy up over 14 percent of supply on exchanges at current prices. In other words, it would gobble up Coinbase’s current order books from now to $100,000 bitcoin prices, <em>18</em> <em>times over</em>! </p><p>If Microsoft was to step in and put merely 5 percent of its cash ($7 billion) on hand into bitcoin, it would buy up 122,000 bitcoin — far more than MicroStrategy’s holdings, which consist of its entire balance sheet and convertible debt issuances. Once the big boys step in, it is a whole other ball game.</p><p>This black hole effect will also be accelerated by the increase of “risk-free” yields that can be generated by arbitraging the difference between spot/future bitcoin prices (also known as cash/carry). These spreads will only widen as bitcoin’s price and volatility increase. For a more detailed explanation on this concept, please reference my previous article, titled “<a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/contango-and-over-collateralization\">Contango and Overcollateralization</a>.”</p><p>As a rule of thumb, equity returns equal price-to-earning ratios (PEs) divided by one. If these free/open market bitcoin yields (that are a byproduct of hyperbitcoinization) blow out to 20 percent, that would mean equity PEs would need to drop from more than 34 to substantially below five to account for risk premium. This would equate to a 75 percent to 80 percent stock market correction. </p><p>The process of hyperbitcoinization will be a mind-melting event. Of course, no one can be fully mentally prepared for. To illustrate the scarcity of one bitcoin, dividing all of the global land by 21 million would mean that one bitcoin would be equivalent to 6,000 acres of land. The spending power that just one bitcoin will hold is incredible and cannot be understated.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by William Clemente III.

The bill would be a major blow to the industry, as it would reportedly penalize anyone holding, trading or mining digital assets, including bitcoin. </p><p>Three years ago, <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/india-lifts-crypto-ban-south-korea-imposes-new-rules-and-the-us-remains-stagnant\">the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) attempted to ban cryptocurrenc</a>y by inhibiting banks from doing business with companies in the industry. Although India’s supreme court struck down the ban in 2020, it now appears that a new, even stricter ban will soon be proposed. </p><p>“The senior official told <em>Reuters</em>, however, that the plan is to ban private crypto-assets while promoting blockchain — a secure database technology that is the backbone for virtual currencies but also a system that experts say could revolutionise international transactions,” <em>Reuters </em>reported. </p><p>This coincides with recent speculation that <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/indias-central-bank-sees-pros-and-cons-with-national-digital-currency-2021-03-01\">India is considering releasing its own central bank digital currency</a> (CBDC). This news suggests that the government understands the potential impact of digital currencies, but are yet to embrace privately-owned ones like bitcoin.</p><p>Despite this regulatory confusion, India remains a potential hotbed for Bitcoin adoption. With a population of 1.3 billion people and a widespread lack of access to traditional banking, Bitcoin could represent the unleashing of individual freedom and monetary access. </p><p>“In India, despite government threats of a ban, transaction volumes are swelling and 8 million investors now hold 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) in crypto-investments, according to industry estimates,” reports <em>Reuters</em>. </p><p>In addition, <a href=\"https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins/INR\">according to data from Coindance</a><em>,</em> India has maintained a consistent LocalBitcoins volume, at 113,772,416 rupee (about $1.5 million) for the week starting on March 3, 2021. The proposed ban, although foreboding, appears to be non-impactful on the transaction volume in India, at least for now. </p><p>It should also be noted that it’s not realistic for a government to “ban” a decentralized technology like Bitcoin, which is a free and open-source software that can be accessed and leveraged without approval from any third-party entity.

Here’s why.</p><!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Early on the morning of March 10, NYDIG, a financial services firm dedicated to Bitcoin and built specifically for institutional clientele, <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nydig-announces-appointment-of-new-york-life-chairman-and-ceo-ted-mathas-to-its-board-of-directors-301244301.html\">announced</a> that Ted Mathas, chairman and CEO of New York Life Insurance Company, would be joining its board of directors. </p><p>New York Life is an insurance giant with more than $700 billion in assets under management as it operates as the nation's largest mutual life insurer. Mathas also serves as the chairman of the American Council of Life Insurers, which represents 280 companies and accounts for 95 percent of the life insurance industry in the United States, with more than $7 trillion in assets under management.</p><p>The news of Mathas joining the board of NYDIG cannot be understated. As signalled by <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/massmutual-buys-100-million-worth-of-bitcoin\">MassMutual buying $100 million worth of bitcoin in early December 2020</a>, the asset has seemingly crossed the rubicon and become sufficiently derisked, and is now crossing into must-own territory for institutional investors and asset managers. While Mathas hasn’t commented publicly on the move, one can reasonably expect that there is plenty of action happening behind the scenes to get the majority of the insurance industry off of a 0 percent bitcoin allocation. The insurance industry and bitcoin are a match made in heaven for several reasons, and it is quite reasonable to expect the industry to allocate in a meaningful way over the coming years. </p><h2>Why The Insurance Industry Needs Bitcoin</h2><h3>Zero Interest Rate Policy</h3><p>In March 2020, the Federal Reserve <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315a1.htm#:~:text=The%20Board%20of%20Governors%20of,%2C%20effective%20March%2016%2C%202020.\">lowered</a> the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp\">federal funds rate</a> to the zero lower bound in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing economic lockdowns. This presents a large challenge for insurance companies that collect premiums with the potential obligation of having to pay out funds to the policyholder at a later date. </p><p>Calculating insurance premiums and potential payouts becomes extremely challenging in an environment where the “risk-free return” of U.S. Treasury bonds are actually presenting return-free risk with negative real yields across nearly the entire yield curve. (This is assuming that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an accurate measure of inflation, but that is a different topic entirely.) Below are the real rates of treasury bonds across the yield curve.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjE5NzY0NDcyMTI4NTkx/pasted-image-0.png\" height=\"257\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>&nbsp;Traditionally, the portfolios of insurance firms held a majority of their assets in bonds. As recently as 2010, insurance firms held 69.7 percent (!!!) of their portfolios in bonds as per the <a href=\"https://www.naic.org/capital_markets_archive/110819.htm\">NAIC</a>. Now, a decade later and <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10\">150 basis points lower on the 10-year treasury</a>, yields offer no real return and very little upside in terms of principal appreciation.</p><p>This dynamic of negative real interest rates does not only have an impact on the bond market, but also the equity market as well. Currently, the United States equity market is worth 192.1 percent of total GDP, the highest reading <em>ever</em>. Regardless of how optimistic one is on the future of the American economy, the expected forward real returns are unfavorable when buying equities at such a steep multiple of current productivity.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjE5NzkwMjQxOTMyMzY3/unnamed.png\" height=\"392\" width=\"620\"></figure><h2>Bitcoin: A Perfected Store Of Value In The Digital Age </h2><p>So, how might the insurance agency combat record-low yields, record high equity multiples and record levels of monetary expansion? Insert: Bitcoin. </p><p>Bitcoin is the perfect store of value for the digital age, and nothing comes close. Most importantly, bitcoin is absolutely scarce, with a perfectly inelastic supply issuance. No one can change the monetary policy of the protocol.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjE5ODAzNjYzNzA1MTY3/unnamed-1.png\" height=\"275\" width=\"620\"><figcaption>Monetary policy dictated by code, not bureaucrats. <a href=\"https://bitcoinblockhalf.com/\">Source</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>A skeptic may bring up that Bitcoin has had the same properties for the past decade, so why does it now make sense for institutional investors to enter the market? </p><p>Undoubtedly, the macro landscape and unprecedented central bank monetary policy has forced investors’ hands, but also notable is that bitcoin has gained a remarkable amount of legitimacy and more importantly liquidity over the last 12 months, making the asset investable to a large pool of capital that previously could not enter the market. Crossing the $1 trillion market cap threshold just recently in February 2021, institutional allocators can now begin to dabble with an allocation. Remember, $1 trillion is still a mere drop in the bucket among hundreds of trillions of dollars in financial assets such as bonds, equities, real estate and gold. </p><p>While this is purely my individual opinion, I suspect that, over the coming decade, asset managers in the insurance industry will come to the realization that there isn't a better way to protect and maintain their balance sheets than by simply stacking sats. Stay humble, stack sats.</p>","summary":"Given current monetary policy, the insurance industry and bitcoin are a match made in heaven.

Since bad habits are hard to break, I wanted to cover this topic for Bitcoin beginners first. This tutorial has been designed for a total Bitcoin beginner, someone who is interested in Bitcoin but has no idea where to begin or what a Bitcoin wallet is or what to do with them.</p><p>With this ongoing five-part series, I hope to have put together an informative guide to some pitfalls to watch out for for new users with a focus on the installation and use of their first Bitcoin wallet and how to obtain non-KYC bitcoin. This way. anybody can bookmark this tutorial and reference it when they have the time and interest. </p><p>This first part is my attempt to help Bitcoin beginners understand my opinions around the importance of self-custody and the dangers of KYC. I wanted to take the time to share these thoughts in long form because I believe that if a person can understand what is at stake, then they will take this stuff more seriously, forming better habits from the beginning. I'm making the guides I wish I had when I was first getting started with Bitcoin.</p><h2>Five Reasons For Self Custody</h2><p>When you install a Bitcoin wallet on your mobile device or desktop, you are taking the radical responsibility of self custody. This means that you and you alone are responsible for your bitcoin. Some of this may be alarming, but it's the honest truth; if you lock yourself out of your wallet, then that is 100 percent your fault and you are responsible for that loss. If you fall victim to a phishing attack and share compromising information with a scammer, that is 100 percent your problem and your loss. There is no customer support hotline in Bitcoin. There is no charge-back feature in Bitcoin. And there is no card-lock security in Bitcoin. Unlike using a bank, you and you alone are responsible for your bitcoin once you cross the threshold into self custody.</p><p>As the saying goes: \"A ship in harbor is safe, but that's not what ships were built for.\"</p><p>You may be asking yourself why I'm such an advocate for self custody after reading that last paragraph.The answer is simple: freedom. With non-KYC bitcoin in self custody, financial permission, confiscation and censorship have no effect on the way that you economically interact with the world. That may come across as hyperbole or a load of buzzwords but let me give you five very real-world examples that may resonate with your life experience.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Maybe you have worked your whole life but you have never been able to set aside a meaningful savings account. Maybe you live paycheck to paycheck and you spend 110 percent or more of your wages every pay period. </p><p>This is because fiat currency like the USD is a terrible store of value. Your purchasing power is continually being siphoned out from underneath you through various forms of inflation, which is effectively confiscation. Every dollar printed is stealing the value of the dollars you accepted in exchange for your time and effort in labor. </p><p>Bitcoin helps ensure that the value stored today will be preserved for the future, and when you self custody your bitcoin, you can verify that your wealth is cryptographically in your possession at all times without trusting a third party. Check the<a href=\"https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cpi/\">Consumer Price Index</a> to see how the cost of a basket of average consumer goods and services has increased over the years. </p><p>The majority of us have only ever seen our money lose purchasing power. If your wages haven't increased by about 160 percent since 1983, then you're falling behind.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjE3OTcxNTkxNzE4MDI1/cpi.png\" height=\"441\" width=\"620\"></figure><p><strong>2.</strong> Maybe you have had your wages garnished — that's a much more direct form of confiscation. Maybe your state government decided that you owed it even more money in taxes than you already paid. Your state government has the authority to siphon money out of your paycheck before you receive it. </p><p>You thought living paycheck to paycheck was tough before? Try opening your paycheck one day to find that 15 percent has been confiscated <em>after</em> your federal income tax and state income tax and medicare and social security and mandatory health insurance have been taken. </p><p>Every Bitcoin transaction must meet the consensus rules, and if a transaction is not signed by the owner, then it will not be accepted. When you self custody, no third party can arbitrarily confiscate what is yours. When centralized authorities are removed from the equation, value can be transferred from peer to peer, uninhibited.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> You've probably been working for a while. Every paycheck you get has medicare and social security taxes taken out that you will likely never benefit from. But the worst part is that every paycheck has a federal income tax taken out as well. </p><p>Federal income taxes are used to pay the interest on the money that the Federal Reserve prints for the United States Treasury. That's right, you have to pay interest out of your pocket for a monetary policy that you have zero voting rights for. In fact, the people operating this monetary policy are not even elected officials, you have absolutely no voice. </p><p>The more money they print, the more purchasing power is confiscated from you, and there is more money circulating for you to pay the interest on. Bitcoin has a 21 million coin hard cap, this means that using bitcoin as a bearer monetary instrument ensures no representative and un-backed IOU is being printed and loaned out for circulating economic activity, thus eliminating the need for an interest-based monetary debt instrument, such as the U.S. dollar. </p><p><strong>4. </strong>Have you ever had a transaction blocked by your bank because it doesn't support the type of business you are attempting to interact with? That's what permission looks like; your money, their rules. </p><p>Maybe the business was totally legal but it's just in a taboo industry, like pornography. Maybe it's legal in your state but illegal at the federal level, like a marijuana business. Maybe, in a not-so-distant future, your political contributions will be blocked unless they align with your bank's vision of the world. </p><p>When your money is in someone else's possession, you have to get their permission to use it. With bitcoin in self custody, so long as your transaction follows the consensus rules, i.e., you're not trying to double spend, then nothing will stop it. No one's opinion of your business is relevant, Bitcoin is software and will execute as expected for any person for any reason, every single time.</p><p><strong>5. </strong>Have you ever been blocked from opening an account at a bank or had your account closed? That's a form of censorship. </p><p>In 2019, when I moved my family to Wyoming in an attempt to leverage its \"crypto friendly\" legislation to start a Bitcoin ATM business, we found out the hard way what financial censorship looked like. We were<a href=\"https://twitter.com/econoalchemist/status/1159509320226299908?s=20\"> rejected by 12 banks</a> in Wyoming, plus one bank in California, two banks in New York and two banks in Colorado — 17 banks in total. Two of them had even opened accounts with us and then promptly shut us down and refunded our deposits once they found out our business was Bitcoin-related. </p><p>Bitcoin ensures that anyone is free to economically interact with the rest of the world. Because of Bitcoin's decentralized nature, there is no central authority to deny your transaction or shut you out of the network. So long as your transaction meets the consensus rules, it will be valid and upheld by the network.</p><p>These are just a few examples of what it means to take self custody of money that is permissionless, cannot be confiscated and is censorship resistant. Third parties and all of the associated risks can be eliminated by using Bitcoin. There are many more examples and I think that if you reflect on your own life experiences, you will find incidents in which you fell victim to these kinds of problems. </p><h2>The Risks Of Trusting Bitcoin Exchanges</h2><p>Let's say you get all that, you understand why bitcoin is better money — with the hard cap, the permissionlessness and the censorship resistance. But you still think that having your bitcoin in the possession of your exchange or broker is better than self-custody. After all, the exchanges deal with huge volumes of bitcoin everyday, so surely they can be trusted with your bitcoin. But therein lies the problem: trust. Let's discuss what you're sacrificing with that trust and see if you still think the same way about self custody afterwards.</p><p>Maybe you have heard of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox\"> Mt. Gox</a>,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriga_Fintech_Solutions\"> Quadriga</a> or<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/uk-crypto-exchange-exmo-says-4m-of-hacked-funds-was-through-poloniex\"> EXMO</a>? These are a few exchanges that had catastrophic impacts on the people who trusted them. </p><p>When an exchange gets hacked, there are no fixes for the end users who have their bitcoin stolen. There is no<a href=\"https://www.fdic.gov/\"> FDIC</a> or<a href=\"https://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects\"> SIPC</a> insurance. Furthermore, there is often no way for the public to verify that an exchange actually has the bitcoin it purports to have. An exchange could potentially sell 100 bitcoin IOUs when it only has 10 actual bitcoin, or it may have zero real bitcoin for that matter. There's no way for the public to know.</p><p>Ask yourself what happens when you've handed your life savings over to Coinbase, for example, and suddenly there is a bitcoin liquidity crisis, and it turns out it sold more in bitcoin IOUs than it actually held in real bitcoin. Do you really think you'll be safe? Do you really think you'll get your money back? If you had your bitcoin in self custody, it would be safe and you could verify its existence for yourself. </p><p>Ask yourself what happens when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission decides that bitcoin trading needs to be halted, like it<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-35\"> arbitrarily decided for 15 publicly-traded stocks</a>. Do you think Coinbase or other regulated exchanges will keep your best interests in mind? </p><p>I want to take a moment to explain another issue that goes hand-in-hand when you trust a custodian with your bitcoin, instead of holding your bitcoin in self custody, and that issue is KYC. </p><h2>The Dangers Of KYC</h2><p>KYC requirements is an invasive scare tactic used to preemptively collect the data and personally-identifiable information about you that would prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, your ownership of bitcoin. Stemming from the<a href=\"https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/supervision-and-examination/bsa/index-bsa.html\"> Bank Secrecy Act</a>, KYC regulations are enforced by the<a href=\"https://www.fincen.gov/\"> Financial Crimes Enforcement Network</a> (FinCEN), a division of the U.S. Treasury. </p><p>These regulations were originally the federal government's attempt to prevent U.S. citizens from funding foreign enemies. However, these regulations have morphed into an excuse for corporations, government contractors and state agents to harvest, track and share your personal information, opening the means by which governments can enforce controls on you. The range of KYC requirements can vary from providing your full name, birth date, email and phone number to your social security number, physical address, IP address, financial background statements, photographs of you holding your government ID, or all of the above.</p><p>Since bitcoin exchanges, brokers and most on ramps are conducting what the federal government considers \"regulated activity,\" these businesses are required by federal law to comply with these regulations. By not complying, a business runs the risk of being fined or shut down, which means that your best interests will always take a back-seat when dealing with regulated entities. </p><p>In recent years, it seems as though the federal government has irrationally raised the KYC requirements when it comes to bitcoin. For example, the<a href=\"https://www.econoalchemist.com/post/fincen-fatf-purposed-travel-rule-changes\"> Travel Rule</a> would require money services businesses to automatically file suspicious activity reports to the federal government for bitcoin transactions exceeding $250 in value that cross a U.S. border, among other things. </p><p>The Travel Rule was fueled in part by the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force\"> Financial Action Task Force</a> (FATF), which is basically a group of assholes that take the broken anti-money laundering (AML) policies of the United States and try to force them into Bitcoin by writing recommendations like<a href=\"https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/virtual-currency-key-definitions-and-potential-aml-cft-risks.pdf\"> this</a>. </p><p>This is the basis for my conjectures that forcing broken legacy system regulations into the Bitcoin ecosystem is abhorrently disastrous. The old financial system has failed miserably, the vast majority of people I know have seen their wages stay stagnant for years, they cannot afford to buy a home in the neighborhoods they grew up in, the money they do have is worth less every year, and 75 percent of all USD in existence has been printed <em>after</em> the launch of Bitcoin in 2009. Bitcoin is not the government's money, they don't get to make the rules.</p><p>Clearly, the rules governing the legacy system have failed, so I find it disturbing that people want to force these same rules into Bitcoin. The rules don't even work in a system where the orchestrators have all of the control, why in the world would anyone think those kinds of rules are going to make Bitcoin better? I say cut the ties, burn the bridge that connects the old world to the new. Central banking is a rotten corpse and I'm sick of its stench.</p><p>The regulations are supposed to inhibit money laundering, however, <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/fincen-files-remind-us-that-bitcoin-is-still-not-for-money-laundering\">the world’s largest banks are the ones facilitating the vast majority of money laundering and when they get caught, the penalties are less than the profits they made, which is incentive to do it again</a>. If you haven't read the articles from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, collectively known as the<a href=\"https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/\"> FinCEN Files</a>, I highly recommend familiarizing yourself with them. Their key findings were:</p><ul><li>Global banks moved more than $2 trillion between 1999 and 2017 in payments that they believed were suspicious, The figures include $514 billion at JPMorgan Chase and $1.3 trillion at Deutsche Bank.</li><li>Five global banks moved illicit cash for shadowy characters and criminal networks even after U.S. authorities fined these financial institutions for earlier failures.</li><li>Banks didn’t have information about one or more entities behind the transactions.</li><li>Years after concerns first emerged, banks continued to move money for fraudsters, drug dealers and allegedly corrupt officials, leading to cases of real harm.</li></ul><p>There is also a cool map of the major transactions that were flagged in suspicious activity reports <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/explore-the-fincen-files-data/\">provided by ICIJ</a>.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NjE3OTk0MTQwMzYxODA3/fincen-files.png\" height=\"242\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>KYC/AML regulations cost businesses billions of dollars, these costs are passed on to the consumers. Ronald Pol of<a href=\"http://www.amlassurance.com/\"> amlAssurance</a> wrote a thought-provoking<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/25741292.2020.1725366?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true\"> article</a> about the costs and effectiveness of KYC/AML policies. He wrote:</p><blockquote><p>\"...anti-money laundering policy intervention has less than 0.1 percent impact on criminal finances, compliance costs exceed recovered criminal funds more than a hundred times over, and banks, taxpayers and ordinary citizens are penalized more than criminal enterprises.\"</p></blockquote><p>Can you see what kind of potential problem is mounting here? There are millions of hard working people who have struggled their entire lives, having their purchasing power confiscated from them through inflation, their money held hostage by the rules of bankers and their freedom of financial expression being censored. These people have discovered a solution to those problems with Bitcoin and they have volunteered their personal information to get it. </p><p>The requirement for that information is a cascading shadow of a failed financial system that prolongs the agonizing death of central banking. As country after country falls into a full blown currency crisis, the demand for bitcoin will increase. This means any information related to individuals who are in possession of bitcoin becomes more valuable. With the sovereignty of nations threatened and the masses left to fend for themselves, survival depends on adaptability and the ability to remain anonymous.</p><p>Thinking adversarially, as any responsible self-custody advocate should, imagine what happens when a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKCMx8nqQhY\"> Ledger-style</a> data breach occurs on an exchange with more detailed personally-identifiable information <em>and</em> the individual's Bitcoin addresses. I'm not even talking about the security of the bitcoin in the exchange's possession, I'm talking about customers’ identifying information linked to their bitcoin holdings being breached.</p><p>Now, imagine a complete currency collapse of the U.S. dollar coupled with an inversely proportional rise in bitcoin demand. Meanwhile, your name, physical address, photograph and the amount of bitcoin you own is publically available. This may sound like I'm being an alarmist, but this will be an unfortunate reality that many people will have to face. People who are known to have bitcoin will be targeted and attempted<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/akdjyg/boom-in-cryptocurrency-marks-the-return-of-bitcoin-kidnappings-in-india\"> kidnappings</a>, ransoms or worse will occur. Start using the tools to protect yourself now.</p><p>It is already known that major exchanges actively partner with law enforcement agencies. Take, for example, the<a href=\"https://www.econoalchemist.com/post/fuck-brian\"> Coinbase/IRS/DEA announcement</a>. These corporations are not your friends, they do not have your best interests in mind, they will protect themselves first and foremost and they will obey the government's commands to make sure that they can stay in business and to make sure<a href=\"https://www.econoalchemist.com/post/intrusive-surveillance-is-someone-s-full-time-job\"> you are the product</a>.</p><p>Consider another attack vector: If the government knows your identifying information and your bitcoin holdings, then you are more likely to become a target of theft through unrealized capital gains taxes, enforcement of a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102\"> 6102-style executive order</a> or full forfeiture of your assets as a matter of \"national security.\" When the sovereignty of a nation-state is threatened, nothing will stand in the way of isolating that threat. Even if it means imprisoning swaths of the population. </p><p>Keep in mind that the whole reason Bitcoin was created is because the ruling authorities completely messed up the money to begin with. Not by accident, but by systematically and methodically destroying the functions of money to purposefully enrich the few and create debt slaves out of the many. For generations, the majority of society has been harvested and used as fuel to keep the machine running. Now that Bitcoin has fixed the money, this thwarts the efforts of those in power to remain in power. They will not give up easily and they will try to drag you down with them.</p><p>Furthermore, KYC information polluting the Bitcoin ecosystem cripples the permissionless state of the network and opens the door for censorship opportunities.</p><p>Spend some time reflecting on these<a href=\"https://6102bitcoin.com/wargame/\"> war games</a>. Hope for the best, be prepared for the worst. Users can mitigate all of the issues listed above and more by taking the radical responsibility of self custody over their non-KYC bitcoin. The first step in doing that is to install a wallet on your Android, iPhone or desktop.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Econoalchemist.

Recently, he has sold his bitcoin, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1360276917992230919\">explaining that</a> it is not today what it should be as far as a stable, usable asset. I agree with him.</p><p>To date, bitcoin has not fulfilled its potential as a currency being used far and wide around the world. But that does not mean it isn’t on a journey to reach that point, one that appears much more promising today than at any other time in the asset’s history.</p><h2>The Journey To Becoming A Useable Asset</h2><p>For most of the last three years, I have questioned whether bitcoin would actually live up to its use case as peer-to-peer, borderless electronic money. Many of us remember the last six months of 2017, when wild speculators artificially drove up the price of bitcoin in a bout of irrational exuberance, only for bitcoin to start a deep decline that maintained over the next year. </p><p>This led to a “digital gold” marketing campaign by Bitcoiners, which I always hated. The call for bitcoin being a “store of value” furthered a narrative that it was not useful for anything else, and jaded my thinking. Had bitcoin simply become a truly speculative instrument with no real inherent value, outside of schillers driving the price up to sell to some sucker who came in later? Was this an elaborate Ponzi scheme where early buyers sell to the next cohort, which is forced to go to Twitter to try to drive prices up again so they can sell at an even higher price? </p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@steven_mcclurg/the-evolution-of-financial-services-e5809d7d17a1\">I wrote about what I thought Bitcoin should be as a usable asset a few years ago</a>, and my disappointment that it was not becoming that. My arguments sounded vaguely familiar to Taleb’s. However, I continued to hold my bitcoin because, despite the fact that I had become a bit disenfranchised, I believed the price would continue to go up, at least to some degree, although at some point in the future, a new blockchain that could securely move global payments at a reasonable price could debut. (Many people believe that Ethereum is the answer, but if you understand how gas prices work, you will quickly see that the cost is too high for it to be efficient, even though it is faster.)</p><p>At the beginning of 2020, my mind started to change again on where Bitcoin was going. I was at a conference called “Satoshi Roundtable,” chatting with a few friends who I see there every year. The subjects that continually came up were: One, rehypothecation of bitcoin and its danger; Two, security; And three, use cases of bitcoin. </p><p>One of my friends had gone to South America to investigate whether the stories of frequent use cases down there were indeed true. The feedback was “not yet” and “not as much as you think.” This only furthered my suspicion that there is not enough price stability for many people to use bitcoin. Though a few people leaving certain countries to rebuild their futures in Florida were using bitcoin as a way to transport their wealth — though this was not enough practical usage to justify the hype that this bitcoin use case had been receiving.</p><p>Typically, low adoption news like this would further have me doubt bitcoin’s use case, but it actually turned me the other way, given my contrarian nature. I concluded that a little use is better than none, and that bitcoin would have to go through a speculative phase to grow to the size it would need to become more useful. Also, you have to apply the law of large numbers to bitcoin to get to a market cap at which the volatility begins to dissipate. </p><h2>The Law Of Large Numbers</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/law-of-large-numbers\">Jakob Bernoulli</a> first proved this theorem regarding large numbers, which many of us know from our studies of statistics. Bernoulli asserted that a small sample size will have a degree of difference from the overall population of study, and as you add more samples to the sample size, the relationship to the broader population converges until the sample is the population. </p><p>The trick in statistical samples is to understand how large the sample has to be in order to track the population within a reasonable margin. The law of large numbers is also applied to economics. In this case, the larger a company gets, the more units it has to produce in order to continue percentage growths. </p><p>In my discipline, I often applied this to country GDP. Smaller countries have to produce less than larger countries to match their GDP growth in percentage terms. Bitcoin is no different. The larger it grows, the less volatile it will become, as it takes much more dollar notional value buys and sells to move the price in percentage terms. In other words, as the bitcoin market cap increases, percentage movements in either direction will become much less, as it will take increasingly more capital and momentum to move the price. For example, when bitcoin was at $10,000, a move to $5,000 was possible, and represented a 50 percent price change. With bitcoin at $50,000, a $5,000 price move to $45,000 is very likely, but this represents only a 10 percent price change at this level.</p><p>As bitcoin’s market cap increases, the law of large numbers dictates that it will be increasingly difficult to move the price, tampering volatility and reducing the potential for price manipulation.</p><h2>Bitcoin’s Phases Of Adoption</h2><p>In order for bitcoin to be useful as a digital currency, the market cap must continue to grow. At first, bitcoin was novel, magic internet money. Money for developers. In the early days, I thought the best use case for bitcoin was to transact across borders for developers working on projects together. </p><p>Pre-Satoshi’s white paper, I worked at Electronic Arts for a couple of years, and it had studios and third-party dev shops all around the world. It was convenient to work on projects across several time zones and to solve localization issues, but it was inconvenient to send money. Bitcoin solved that problem, but bitcoin used to be too complicated for anyone but a developer to store and transact. As other financial services people started getting into bitcoin and exchanges started to pop up, all of that began to change. We began to speculate on the promise of a digital currency, and with that speculation, along came financial speculators.</p><p>In late 2016 and 2017, we began to see a gold rush in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, including many scam coins. At conferences and Bitcoin meetups, new characters entered: gold brokers, get-rich-quick scammers, former financial services professionals who were not allowed to transact in securities anymore, people who had been to prison — the list goes on. </p><p>They saw cryptocurrencies as a fast cash opportunity and pushed the market beyond its limit in late 2017. It didn’t end well for many, and the next three years were spent recovering, building and regaining legitimacy. </p><p>We are still in a speculative stage, but a much more measured one than four years ago. But a speculative stage is needed to grow the market cap to a size where broader transactions become possible. What are we speculating on? That bitcoin will be a broadly-adopted global currency. And this is no different than any other forex investment. But instead of speculation on a country’s GDP growth and economic development making its currency stronger, bitcoin speculation is the bet that the digital economy will grow without the need for financial intermediaries, across borders, and that central bank-based currencies will devalue.</p><p>I am making the bet that all of this will happen, and that it is happening rapidly.</p><p>As speculation gives to promise, bitcoin makes way for more real-world use. As I write this, bitcoin’s market cap is now $1 trillion, versus $200 billion a year ago.</p><p>In 2021, more companies that transact digitally will hold bitcoin on their balance sheets; no differently than a global company holding a certain amount of foreign currency reserves. When the first large company, MicroStrategy, <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/microstrategy-buys-0-1-percent-of-total-bitcoin-supply\">made this play</a> it was big news. Its market cap was only $1 billion, though. Next was <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/its-happening-tesla-buys-1-5-billion-of-bitcoin\">Tesla</a>, with a market cap of $670 billion. As more companies make this announcement, the news will have an increasingly smaller effect, with lower market cap companies not having much of an affect on bitcoin price. This is the law of large nmbers.</p><h2>Future Use</h2><p>After bitcoin gets to the $500,000 price range, I believe we will begin to see more transactions and daily use. Projects are already built that allow multiple-transaction use cases. BAKKT, Coinbase and Gemini have wallets that allow you to send bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies between friends (like with Venmo) and to merchants. Tesla will accept bitcoin as payment for cars. Paydrop and Wyre allow payments to W-2 and contract workers in bitcoin. </p><p>What is preventing mass use of these tools today and transacting more in bitcoin?</p><p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703956604576110371253623328\">This story about cotton might provide some answers.</a></p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NTQ5NzU1NDMxNDYxOTY3/image1-2.jpg\" height=\"413\" width=\"620\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703956604576110371253623328\">Source</a><br></figcaption></figure><p><em>This is a guest post by Steven McClurg.

As a result, demand for these assets has driven down global interest rates for decades (see chart below) creating a liquidity trap — a condition where yields on government bonds and cash are so close that many prefer to hoard cash. This means that, as money is created by central banks, much of it essentially becomes locked away on private balance sheets (bank, corporate and individual) to satisfy the demand for liquid savings. Failure of governmental institutions to produce enough safe assets has contributed to the falling monetary velocity, slow growth in the Eurozone and Japan and structural lack of labor in the United States.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NTI1NjQ3NTExNTk0MTIx/image1-1.jpg\" height=\"418\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>But what if this demand for savings could be satisfied by something other than government bonds or currency? Enter Bitcoin. </p><p>As cited by David Andofatto of the St. Louis Federal Reserve in his blog post entitled “<a href=\"http://andolfatto.blogspot.com/2016/03/is-bitcoin-safe-asset.html\">Is Bitcoin A Safe Asset?</a>,” bitcoin “…could be the world’s next great safe asset. At least, it certainly seems to have all the properties that are desired in a safe asset.” </p><p>The blog goes on to describe some of Bitcoin’s attributes, including its simple monetary policy and fixed supply, with the implication being that this is a role that bitcoin <em>could</em> serve. </p><p>But to be clear, it is not there now, so this is a stretch goal for bitcoin. But if we zoom 20 years into the future and assume tht the bitcoin market capitalization reaches maturity ($20 trillion-plus), its volatility will likely stabilize as sales and purchases totaling many billions of dollars each day would fail to spike or crater the price. </p><p>Under such circumstances, as a safe asset, bitcoin could be expected to appreciate near the rate of nominal GDP, say 4 percent to 6 percent per year, on average (see chart below). That is, as the number and price of goods and services expands globally, after several more bitcoin mining subsidy halving cycles, the total supply of new bitcoin barely increases — increasing numerator, fairly constant denominator. Boring for traders, but ideal as a safe asset.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NTI1NjYxMjAxODAyMzc3/unnamed-2.png\" height=\"432\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>&nbsp;So, how would bitcoin solve this problem? Essentially, I am arguing for a type of currency duopoly. Bitcoin could effectively soak up much of the demand for long-term savings, and fiat would still be used for everyday spending.</p><p>The key here is that the global economy would no longer rely as much on the production of safe assets by governments. Because bitcoin is not debt-based like government bonds or bank deposits, it is not constrained by interest rates falling to the zero lower bound. Any increase in demand for bitcoin is accommodated by a corresponding increase in price. This does not mean bank deposits won’t still exist or that governments won’t issue debt. Both will persist, but their rates and term structures would need to reflect the availability of another highly-liquid, non-governmental, safe asset: bitcoin. </p><p>Those who argue that bitcoin will someday be used ubiquitously for spending are ignoring that bitcoin’s properties make it ideal for hoarding. Why spend bitcoin when you could spend fiat instead? Some would claim this dual currency theory is far-fetched, yet I would argue currency duopolies exist all over the globe today. </p><p>Go to any third-world country and you will find people there who are eager to receive U.S. dollars for payments, which they save, while they spend their local fiat. They lack faith in their governmental institutions to preserve the value of their local currencies. It is not unreasonable to therefore assume that bitcoin could serve this role globally across all economies, including the U.S. </p><p>As bitcoin replaces fiat and debt as a vehicle for saving, central banks globally would need to produce less fiat to satisfy the demand for liquid savings, and the problem of monetary velocity falling for decades could potentially be solved (see the M2 velocity chart below). As monetary velocity accelerates again, incomes go up because one person’s spending is another’s income. And when incomes go up and labor markets get tight, businesses have incentive to invest in new products and services, as well as to enhance the productivity of existing workers. Business investment is pro-cyclical. That is, it peaks when the economy is running near its potential, and as unemployment falls, investment rises (see the net private domestic investment chart below). In short, when the virtuous cycle of money flows is reestablished, prosperity could be felt more widely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NTI1NjczNTQ5ODMzMjk1/unnamed-3.jpg\" height=\"418\" width=\"620\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NTI1Njg4MDQ1MzQ3OTE5/image4.png\" height=\"433\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>To be clear, this rosy picture is a long way from reality, but we are seeing seeds being planted today, as a small number of corporations and individuals have chosen to replace their fiat savings with bitcoin. It is not illogical to think this trend will continue. </p><p>The implication for central banks is that, when fiat is created, it will be more quickly spent, resulting in more effective monetary policy. For governments, a currency duopoly creates no threat to government power. It can still borrow and spend fiat into the economy as needed to achieve its goals (provide for the common defense, infrastructure, social safety nets, etc.). Indeed, the presence of U.S. dollars or debt does not prevent Mexico, or any other foreign government, from carrying out its day-to-day duties. In my view, the emergence of bitcoin would be a clear winner for all involved. </p><p>So, why is no one writing about this potential benevolent future? I suspect most bitcoiners do not understand monetary economics or the safe asset shortage, and most academics are loath to discuss “crazy” bitcoin in general. </p><p>Perhaps the Austrian economists will counter that bitcoin will drive out <em>all</em> other forms of money and the Modern Monetary Theorists will claim that <em>only</em> government can give currency value. Heck, even mainstream economists may disagree on the extent to which the safe asset shortage is a problem or a symptom. Those aside, my aim with this article is to facilitate the discussion. These are admittedly complicated subjects that I am simplifying — a lot. But hopefully, in due time, more economists will start taking bitcoin and its broader economic implications a bit more seriously.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Monetary Wonk.

He tells us that Bitcoin first popped up on his radar all the way back in 2010. He didn’t dive too deep into it then and get involved, unfortunately, but not long after, he heard about it again when PayPal was blocking bitcoin payments. This caught his attention even more and then he dove headfirst into bitcoin in 2017 during the last bull run. And the rest is history!</p><p>Over the course of this interview, Labra shared that adopting a lower time preference has changed his life and allowed him to save more. We talked a bit about responsibility and work experience. Many kids and teenagers today (here in the U.S.) do not work anymore. Working summer/winter jobs and doing work like mowing grass and raking leaves are opportunities wasted by so many today. They are not learning the responsibility that having a job takes and then the responsibility of the money that comes with it. </p><p>Some of Labra’s favorite things about Bitcoin are the ability to self custody your wealth and the opportunity to store your monetary energy into a capped supply of 21 million. Your wealth does not get inflated away with bitcoin and that allows you to actually save your wealth. It’s impossible to save in fiat, so this is life changing. And also, he’s extremely bullish on the Bitcoin Zoomers!</p><p>Below are some of Labra’s most interesting thoughts shared during the interview. And be sure to check out the full episode for more.</p><h2>How Did You Find Bitcoin And Fall Down The Rabbit Hole?</h2><p>The first time I heard about Bitcoin was around 2010 or 2011, I used to follow WikiLeaks a lot, and one day, I read the news that PayPal froze WikiLeaks' donations and that WikiLeaks started to accept donations in bitcoin. I didn't pay too much attention but the seed was planted. </p><p>I didn't buy my first bitcoin until the crazy bull run of 2017. I bought in December at $12,000, Bitcoin was on the news and I could not ignore it anymore, I saw it go to $20,000 and I didn't understand what was going on, then it crashed down to $3,000. During 2018 to 2019, I took the time to educate myself and understand the economics and technology, I wanted to understand what is that thing that just goes crazy on price. Then, the March 2020 crash came and I found Bitcoin Twitter with all of the cool memes and awesome PLEBS. I became a hardcore stacker since then.</p><h2>How Has Bitcoin Changed Your Life?</h2><p>My time preferences have changed radically. I used to get paid and I had to spend that money. Where I am living right now, the inflation rate is around 10 percent per year, according to the government, but in reality it is around 15 percent to 20 percent. In a way, that forces you to spend your fiat fast, otherwise, it loses value. I’m glad we have Bitcoin, thanks to Satoshi and all the people who contribute.</p><h2>What Is The Most Amazing Thing About Bitcoin To You?</h2><p>The fact that we can send value across time and space is something that we have never seen before and very few people understand. </p><h2>What Are You Most Looking Forward To In The Bitcoin Space?</h2><p>The Lightning Network is something that amazes me, instant payments and being accessible to anybody who has a mobile phone. It's incredible that you can send money instantly at any time to the other side of the planet. </p><h2>What Is Your Price Prediction For The End Of 2021 And The End Of 2030?</h2><p>I'm really bad at giving price predictions. The target is <em>infinity,</em> LOL, but by the end of 2021, I wouldn’t be surprised to see bitcoin at $100,000 and above $1 million by 2030. (Yes, I know that’s a little bearish, insert bear emoji here LOL) all because of NGU, the #CONTANGO and #SATSQUEEZE.</p>","summary":"For this episode of Bitcoin Magazine’s “Meet The Taco Plebs,” Labra HODL (@labrahodl6), one of the star memers of Bitcoin Twitter, spoke about his Bitcoin journey.","date_published":"2021-03-10T21:28:18.000Z","author":{"name":"Nik Hoffman"}},{"guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/digital-currency-group-to-invest-250-million-in-grayscale-bitcoin-trust","url":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/digital-currency-group-to-invest-250-million-in-grayscale-bitcoin-trust","title":"Digital Currency Group To Invest $250 Million In Grayscale Bitcoin Trust","content_html":"<p class=\"subtitle\">Digital Currency Group, the parent of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s manager, plans to invest $250 million to gain indirect exposure to bitcoin.</p><!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005273/en/Digital-Currency-Group-Announces-Plan-to-Purchase-Shares-of-Grayscale-Bitcoin-Trust-OTCQX-GBTC\">Digital Currency Group (DCG) announced</a> an authorization to purchase $250 million worth of shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).</p><p>DCG is the parent company of Grayscale Investments, which manages GBTC.

Evolve has many ETF products centered around disruptive technologies and Johnson has a lot of experience launching products like these and working with regulators on financial products, so the hosts took the opportunity to dive deeply into this area of his expertise and get his view on bitcoin and the macroeconomic climate in general. As you can tell, it ended up being a pretty broad conversation.</p><p>It was nice for Keroles and Lindner to interview an industry professional who is, perhaps we can say, tangential to bitcoin. While Evolve is not technically a bitcoin-only company, it has several ETF products in the space. Johnson explained how its bitcoin ETF was the first product it tried to launch back in 2017, but regulators weren’t ready for it back then. Evolve kept trying and now has introduced one of the three bitcoin ETFs that were launched in Canada in the last month.</p><p>Johnson said that, though the process took several years, Canada is emerging as a forward-thinking financial jurisdiction. They are very comfortable with disruptive new products, and he hopes to maintain the good working relationship with the Ontario Securities Commission in the future. </p><p>Next, the hosts brought the conversation back to the U.S. and dove deeply into Johnson's view on Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and its current discount. He chalked it up to the opening up of competition in the space. This is a convincing argument, because the month prior to Canada’s three major bitcoin ETFs launching, the premium on GBTC was 40 percent. Today, it sits at -10 percent. Johnson also, obviously, leans toward the ETF structure as being superior to the trust-based structure of GBTC. Open-ended ETFs will remain closer to net asset value (NAV) of the underlying asset than a close-ended trust can. </p><p>The hosts also got into Johnson's macro vision of what’s going on right now and where bitcoin fits. He is quite keen on bitcoin as digital gold, fulfilling a large need for an alternate storage asset. When asked about where he sees the industry going in the next five to ten years, Johnson focused on the growing respect of the asset class. He also made an interesting point, that in his daily interactions with interested investors of this bitcoin ETF, they tend to be those who do not own bitcoin in any other capacity already. It is not current holders looking to diversify, but it is all new investor demand.</p><p>Lastly, the hosts asked for his advice to new investors and his opinion on a healthy bitcoin allocation in a portfolio. Of course, he was very professional and suggested talking to your financial advisor, and he ended on the need for continued work on education in the space.&nbsp;</p>","summary":"In this episode of Bitcoin Magazine’s \"Fed Watch\" podcast, hosts Christian Keroles and Ansel Lindner spoke with Elliot Johnson of Evolve ETFs.","date_published":"2021-03-10T18:34:16.000Z","author":{"name":"Ansel Lindner"}},{"guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-optech-bitcoin-technical-updates-newsletter-139","url":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-optech-bitcoin-technical-updates-newsletter-139","title":"Bitcoin Optech: Bitcoin Technical Updates Newsletter #139","content_html":"<p class=\"subtitle\">This issue of Bitcoin Optech covers Taproot activation discussion, the release of Eclair 0.5.1 and more.</p><!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p><em>The <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/\">Bitcoin Optech </a>newsletter provides readers with a top-level summary of the most important technical news happening in Bitcoin, along with resources that help them learn more.

Some proposals included:<ul><li><em>User Activated Soft Fork (UASF):</em> a plan being <a href=\"http://gnusha.org/uasf/2021-03-02.log\">discussed</a> to implement BIP8 <code>LOT=true</code> in a software fork of Bitcoin Core that mandates miners signal for activation of taproot by July 2022 (as widely proposed), but which also allows miners to activate it earlier.</li><li><em>Flag day:</em> several proposals (<a href=\"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018495.html\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018538.html\">2</a>) to program into nodes a specific block height or time roughly 18 months from now (as proposed) where taproot activates. Miner signaling is not required to cause activation and cannot cause earlier activation. Anthony Towns wrote a <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21378\">draft implementation</a>.</li><li><em>Decreasing threshold:</em> several proposals (<a href=\"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018476.html\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018587.html\">2</a>) to gradually decrease over time the number of blocks that must signal readiness for miners to enforce taproot before the new consensus rules lock in. See also Anthony Town’s proposal from last year described in <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2020/07/22/#mailing-list-thread\">Newsletter #107</a>.</li><li><em>A configurable LOT:</em> in addition to previously-discussed proposals to make BIP8’s <code>LOT</code> value a configuration option (see <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/02/24/#taproot-activation-discussion\">Newsletter #137</a>), rough code was <a href=\"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018514.html\">posted</a> showing how <code>LOT=true</code> could be enforced via an external script calling RPC commands. Additional code was <a href=\"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018512.html\">created</a> showing how <code>LOT=true</code> could also be opposed by node operators who were worried about it creating block chain instability.</li><li><em>A short-duration attempt at miner activation:</em> an <a href=\"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018583.html\">updated proposal</a> to give miners approximately three months to lock in taproot, starting from soon after the release of a full node implementing the activation logic. If the attempt failed, the community would be encouraged to move on to a different activation method. If the attempt succeeded, there would still be a several month delay before taproot activated to allow most of the economy to upgrade their nodes. A <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21377\">draft implementation</a> for this proposal based on Bitcoin Core’s existing <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki\">BIP9</a> implementation was also written by Anthony Towns. Andrew Chow created an <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/21392\">alternative draft implementation</a> based on the previously proposed BIP8 implementation.</li></ul>It seemed unlikely any of the proposals would ever become almost everyone’s first choice, but it appeared that a large number of people were <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/michaelfolkson/92899f27f1ab30aa2ebee82314f8fe7f\">willing to accept</a> the short-duration attempt under the name <em>Speedy Trial</em>. There were still a few concerns with it, including:<ul><li><em>Could be co-opted for mandatory activation:</em> even though the proposal explicitly encourages making other activation attempts if miners don’t quickly signal sufficient support for taproot, a concern was <a href=\"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-March/018596.html\">expressed</a> that it could be co-opted by a group of users seeking fast mandatory activation, although it was <a href=\"http://gnusha.org/taproot-activation/2021-03-06.log\">noted</a> that no group has previously expressed the desire to attempt mandatory activation on such a dangerously short timeline.</li><li><em>Using time-based or height-based parameters:</em> the proposal describes the tradeoffs between setting its <code>start</code>, <code>timeout</code>, and <code>minimum_activation</code> parameters using either times (based on the median of the previous 11 blocks) or block heights. Using times would result in the smallest and easiest to review patch to Bitcoin Core. Using heights would provide a bit more predictability, especially for miners, and would be compatible with other attempts using BIP8.</li><li><em>Myopic:</em> there was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rusty_twit/status/1368325392591822848\">concern</a> that the proposal is too focused on the short term: “Speedy Trial fully prepares for the (likely) case where miners activate taproot, but it does nothing to codify lessons learned from Segwit’s failure to activate in a timely manner. We have an opportunity with the activation of taproot to create a template for future activations that will clearly define the roles and responsibilities for developers, miners, merchants, investors, and end users in all the ways an activation can progress, not just the best-case outcomes; in particular enabling and enshrining the final arbiter role held by Bitcoin’s economic users. Defining this will only get more difficult in the future, both because we’ll only do so when we’re already in crisis, and because Bitcoin’s growth means future agreement will need to be done at greater scale and so with greater difficulty.”</li><li><em>Speed:</em> the proposal, based on initial discussion from the ##taproot-activation IRC channel, proposes giving miners about three months to lock in taproot and waiting a fixed six months from the start of signal measuring before activation (if lock in is achieved).

But where exactly are these operations drawing their power from?</p><!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>In his introduction to Michael Saylor’s recent conference “<a href=\"https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit\">Bitcoin For Corporations</a>,” Ross Stevens, founder and CEO of Stone Ridge and NYDIG, <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wA_fI-wUqnw\">spoke</a> about the importance of energy to bitcoin, and how bitcoin mining will create new economic hubs in areas where stranded energy exists.</p><p>Until now, human settlements have been located near transportation hubs, he noted, not energy hubs. But the need for cheap, abundant energy like hydropower makes bitcoin mining a natural pioneer in those areas where industries like forestry and pulp and paper have exhausted resources and moved on, leaving energy infrastructure behind.</p><p>In “<a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/a-hitchhikers-guide-to-bitcoin-mining-in-north-america\">A Hitchhiker’s Guide To Bitcoin Mining In North America</a>,” we attempted to sketch out the rough outlines of the emerging bitcoin mining ecosystem on the continent where much of this energy pioneering is and will be taking place. We listed mining pools, mining companies, financial services firms and firmware companies.</p><p>In this second part, <em>Bitcoin Magazine</em> is continuing this journey of discovery to shed more light on what this new mining ecosystem looks like and, more specifically, what sources of energy are available and being used. </p><p>But this is no easy task. In digital asset firm CoinShares’s <a href=\"https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-december-2019\">report</a> on bitcoin mining from December 2019, the researchers expressed the difficulty of trying to pin down an accurate picture of where miners work and what energy they’re using: </p><p>“...while we do our utmost to accurately pinpoint the location of global mining centres, the Bitcoin mining industry remains a highly private and secretive industry,” they wrote. “As a result, our estimates may be subject to significant potential uncertainty.”</p><h2>The North American Energy Landscape</h2><p>There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that North America is experiencing a new gold rush as mining companies stake claims, form partnerships and order large inventories of the latest ASIC technology.</p><p>North America is a new mining mecca, primarily because there’s lots of cheap, “stranded” energy in the region, making it a new frontier for mining companies and investors, according to Marty Bent of Great American Mining and Harry Sudock of Griid, who discussed the matter on a recent <a href=\"https://www.happyscribe.com/public/we-study-billionaires-the-investor-s-podcast-network/marty-bent-and-harry-sudock-bitcoin-podcast\">podcast</a> about mining and energy.</p><p>For example, British Columbia and Quebec, two of Canada’s largest economies, were built on resource extraction, mainly forestry and traditional mining. But many of the region’s lumber and pulp and paper mills powered by hydroelectric dams have moved on or closed, <a href=\"https://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/crypto-craze-has-hydro-quebec-ceos-phone-ringing-off-the-hook\">leaving power sources and infrastructure behind</a>.</p><p>Areas of Washington State and Upper New York State have similar advantages — lots of cheap stranded energy from a time when manufacturing dominated the region and factories needed to be near power sources to be economical.</p><p>In light of the ongoing debate about the environmental impact of the energy that bitcoin miners use, it is helpful to know the terrain.</p><p>On this front, China presents a relatively clear picture — mostly hydropower in the rainy season and coal and natural gas in the dry season.</p><p>But many U.S. states have a mix of power sources on the local grid, often including coal, natural gas, nuclear and hydro power. This makes it difficult to pin down power sources used by individual companies.</p><p>But despite the difficulty of pinpointing precise energy allocations, it’s clear that this region is attracting a significant proportion of bitcoin mining operations, particularly from Asia.</p><p>“The migration of hash out of China over time by existing players is very, very rapid and they're very motivated,” said Bent on the recent podcast. “So, if you're operating on any of those hydro facilities in China, there's significant seasonality. You're already moving cash in between locations. And so they're incentivized to avoid those switching costs to migrate to regions where there is stable access to power.”</p><p>It’s the nature of bitcoin mining that miners “seek out extremely cheap sources of energy which tend to be stranded renewables or fossil fuels like natural gas and oil via flaring or venting that would otherwise be wasted,” added Bent.</p><p>And it’s not just Chinese miners that are looking for a new frontier. A growing interest in mining from institutions like investment funds is spurring growth in the U.S. and Canada as established investors look for areas with not only cheap, abundant energy but a degree of political and regulatory certainty.</p><p>Underscoring the types of uncertainty these investors hope to avoid in China, there are reports that China’s government will be regulating miners working in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang in an attempt to curtail the use of coal.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1366381727866892288\">https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1366381727866892288</a></p><p>This may help make North America a more attractive location for Chinese mining companies.</p><h2>Shifting The Energy Paradigm</h2><p>Cambridge University’s Centre for Alternative Finance is <a href=\"https://cbeci.org\">studying</a> the use of energy in bitcoin mining and has developed its “<a href=\"https://cbeci.org\">Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index”</a> to try and gauge the amount of power consumed by the bitcoin network, broken down by individual regions.</p><p>The center calls its results “an educated guess” due to the many variables, including location, that are still largely unknown. Researchers used aggregate data from three mining pools that are based in China — BTC.com, Poolin and ViaBTC — as samples for its projections.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://cbeci.org/mining_map\">resulting “Bitcoin Mining Map”</a> shows the average monthly hash rate (power usage) broken down by country. At the time of this writing, China leads the world at more than 65 percent of total energy use, while the U.S. contributes 7.24 percent and Canada 0.82 percent.</p><p>The Cambridge Centre is also studying the kind of energy used in different parts of the Bitcoin network. In a <a href=\"https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-ccaf-3rd-global-cryptoasset-benchmarking-study.pdf\">September 2020 report</a>, it found that 76 percent of surveyed mining operations used renewable energy as part of their energy mix. Hydroelectric power was found to be the most used source of energy, with 62 percent of respondents indicating that this source powered their mining operations.</p><p>Coal was the next-most-used energy source, with 38 percent of respondents indicating that it powered their operations, and natural gas came in third with 36 percent of respondents indicating that it powered their operations.</p><p>CoinShares has also studied the use of energy on the network and has estimated how much energy use is derived from renewables. It noted the mining industry is “notoriously opaque” making it difficult to analyze with certainty.</p><p>In its December 2019 report, it pegged the use of renewables at 73 percent, making bitcoin mining one of the cleanest industries in the world:</p><p>“...we calculate an estimate of the renewables penetration in the energy mix powering the Bitcoin mining network at 73 percent, making Bitcoin mining more renewables-driven than almost every other large-scale industry in the world,” according to the report.</p><p>The future development of bitcoin mining in North America is the future development of stranded energy.</p><p>In his remarks at “Bitcoin For Corporations,” Stevens called bitcoin the “most profitable use of energy in human history that doesn’t need to be located near human settlements,” saying that bitcoin will change the economics of energy.</p><p>Though the exact energy sources are difficult to parse, it’s clear that the story of bitcoin mining in North America is the story of bitcoin finding this game-changing economic use case for the energy industry. As Austin Storms, the director of product and engineering for Great American Mining put it on Twitter recently, this is a paradigm shift on par with the advent of the internet itself.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/austorms/status/1366023459625648132\">https://twitter.com/austorms/status/1366023459625648132</a></p><h2>Appendix: Bitcoin Mining Companies in North America </h2><p>Below is a partial list of Bitcoin mining companies based in North America, along with their specific regions of operation:</p><h3>Canada</h3><p><strong>Alberta:</strong></p><ul><li>Hut 8 Mining</li><ul><li>Drumheller</li><li>Medicine Hat</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Upstream Data</li><ul><li>Calgary</li></ul></ul><p><strong>British Columbia:</strong></p><ul><li>DMG Blockchain Solutions </li><ul><li>Christina Lake</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Iris Energy</li><ul><li>Canal Flats</li></ul></ul><ul><li>MaaS Blockchain</li><ul><li>Lower Mainland </li></ul></ul><ul><li>Ocean Falls Blockchain</li><ul><li>Ocean Falls</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Quebec:</strong></p><ul><li>BitFarms </li><ul><li>Brossard </li><li>Cowansville</li><li>Farnham</li><li>Magog</li><li>Sherbrooke</li><li>St. Hyacinthe</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Blockstream Mining </li><ul><li>Montreal </li></ul></ul><ul><li>HIVE Blockchain Technologies</li><ul><li>Lachute</li></ul></ul><h3>U.S.</h3><p><strong>California:</strong></p><ul><li>Plouton Mining</li><ul><li>Mojave</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Colorado:</strong></p><ul><li>Frontier Mining </li></ul><p><strong>Georgia:</strong></p><ul><li>Blockcap</li></ul><ul><li>Blockstream Mining</li><ul><li>Adel</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Core Scientific</li></ul><p><strong>Idaho:</strong></p><ul><li>XTRA Bitcoin</li><ul><li>Fruitland</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Illinois:</strong></p><ul><li>Blockware Solutions</li><ul><li>Chicago</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Iowa:</strong></p><ul><li>Vortex Blockchain Technologies</li><ul><li>Des Moines</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Kentucky:</strong></p><ul><li>Blockcap</li></ul><ul><li>Core Scientific </li></ul><p><strong>Maine:</strong></p><ul><li>Northern Data Systems</li><ul><li>Falmouth</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Minnesota: </strong></p><ul><li>Compute North</li><ul><li>Eden Prairie</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Montana:</strong></p><ul><li>Marathon Patent Group</li><ul><li>Big Horn</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Nebraska:</strong></p><ul><li>Barefoot Mining</li><ul><li>Omaha</li></ul><li>Compute North</li><ul><li>Kearney</li></ul></ul><p><strong>New York State:</strong></p><ul><li>Coinmint </li><ul><li>Massena</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Greenidge Generation</li><ul><li>Dresden</li></ul></ul><p><strong>North Carolina:</strong></p><ul><li>Core Scientific </li><ul><li>Marble</li></ul></ul><p><strong>North Dakota:</strong></p><ul><li>Crusoe Energy Systems</li><ul><li>Bakken Oil Fields</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Equinor</li><ul><li>Bakken Oil Fields</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Marathon Patent Group</li></ul><p><strong>Ohio: </strong></p><ul><li>Bit5ive</li></ul><p><strong>Oklahoma:</strong></p><ul><li>Riot Blockchain</li><ul><li>Oklahoma City</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong></p><ul><li>Bit5ive</li></ul><p><strong>South Carolina:</strong></p><ul><li>Treis Mining</li><ul><li>Greer</li></ul></ul><p><strong>South Dakota:</strong></p><ul><li>Barefoot Mining</li><ul><li>North Sioux City</li></ul></ul><ul><li>BitMOR Mining</li><ul><li>Canton</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Compute North</li><ul><li>Sioux City</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Texas:</strong></p><ul><li>Bitmain</li><ul><li>Rockdale</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Compute North </li><ul><li>Big Spring </li></ul></ul><ul><li>Layer1</li></ul><ul><li>Whinstone</li><ul><li>Rockdale</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Utah:</strong></p><ul><li>Orem Mining</li></ul><p><strong>Virginia:</strong></p><ul><li>BitFrontier</li><ul><li>Fredericksburg</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Washington State:</strong></p><ul><li>Bitmain Mining</li></ul><ul><li>Elite Mining</li></ul><ul><li>SCATE Ventures</li></ul><ul><li>Soluna</li></ul><p><strong>West Virginia: </strong></p><ul><li>BOTS</li></ul><p><strong>Wyoming:</strong></p><ul><li>Wyoming Mining</li><ul><li>Afton&nbsp;</li></ul></ul>","summary":"North America’s bitcoin mining industry is changing the way we use energy.

This is the type of content that Bitcoiners have dreamed of seeing, a letter from a billionaire on why bitcoin is important and how his team can build a brighter future for their company by operating on a Bitcoin standard.</p><p>Below are three of my most bullish takeaways from the letter with some explanation of why they’re so important:</p><p>1. The steep learning curve to understanding Bitcoin has repelled many, allowing for the strong and determined to rise to the top and grasp it, while accumulating it. One of the reasons for this is because many are not taught about the monetary properties of money that make it valuable. They see money only as a medium of exchange so naturally, they unconsciously reject Bitcoin because it completely breaks their worldview.</p><p>“You can only challenge preconceived ideas when you are willing to go outside of your comfort zone,” Røkke wrote. “Bitcoin has inspired us to challenge our intuitive understanding of money.”</p><p>As Røkke explains, his company also had its personal beliefs about money challenged by Bitcoin. This is great confirmation bias to see, as after all the plebs on Bitcoin Twitter realized Bitcoin is a great teacher on money and economics, billionaires are seeing this as well. And if all of us are understanding this, then it’s only a matter of time before the rest of the world does as well.</p><p>2. Røkke has a whole section dedicated to explaining why \"not investing is the riskiest decision\" when it comes to the question of “should I buy bitcoin or not?” The importance of this section cannot be underestimated because not having a position in bitcoin <em>is</em> having a position in bitcoin. And it’s not a position you’d want to take.</p><p>Bitcoin is money, and there are consequences to holding money that is less hard than the hardest money. Because BTC was the best-performing asset of the last decade, bitcoin’s value has risen astronomically while every other asset in the entire world lost value against it. As more figure this out, it tends to light a fire underneath them and motivate them to accumulate more bitcoin. Because at that point, you realize how short on bitcoin you really are.</p><p>3. Today, most young entrepreneurs and investors seem to have had “minimize risk” and “don’t take unnecessary risks, always play it safe” beaten into their heads. The “always play it safe” part is a horrible thing to teach people who aim to be successful.

The company will focus on investing in Bitcoin-focused projects and will hold all liquid assets in bitcoin.</p><p>“First, we will use bitcoin as our trea­sury as­set and join the community,” the letter, penned by Røkke, reads. “In Bit­coin speak, we will be hodlers... Sec­ond, See­tee will es­tab­lish min­ing op­er­a­tions that trans­fer strand­ed or in­ter­mit­tent elec­tric­i­ty with­out sta­ble de­mand lo­cal­ly — wind, so­lar, hy­dro pow­er — to eco­nom­ic as­sets that can be used any­where. Bit­coin is, in our eyes, a load-bal­anc­ing eco­nom­ic bat­tery, and bat­ter­ies are es­sen­tial to the en­er­gy tran­si­tion re­quired to reach the tar­gets of the Paris Agreement...Third, we will build and in­vest in projects and companies in Bit­coin’s ecosystem. This is where our true pas­sion is!” </p><p>The letter also noted that Seetee will commit to not only holding bitcoin as a reserve asset, but also actively investing in the physical and digital infrastructure being built on top of and around the network. </p><p>This news is extremely bullish because, as Røkke himself addresses, the Bitcoin protocol and the underlying value of bitcoin the asset is a function of the utility it provides to its users and stakeholders. With the statements made in the shareholder letter, Seetee announced its intention to be involved in all aspects.</p><h2>“Not Investing Is The Riskiest Decision”</h2><blockquote><p>“Risk is not an ob­vi­ous con­cept. What’s commonly considered risky is frequent­ly not. And vice ver­sa. We are used to think­ing that cash is risk free. But it’s not. It’s implicitly taxed by inflation at a small rate every year… Inflation is very good for debtors. And the U.S. is the world’s largest debtor. They owe the bond own­ers. And they owe pensions. Both groups may be out of luck in the long term.”</p></blockquote><p>In what is becoming an increasingly-accepted view, the shareholder’s letter raised concerns about the fragility and long-term stability of the global fiat monetary system that has been in place since 1971. While bitcoin may still have significant day-to-day volatility, at the base layer, bitcoin is the antithesis of volatility and fragililty, with a hard-capped supply of 21 million paired with perfect supply inelasticity. Røkke also addressed the asymmetric upside offered by bitcoin and involvement in the broader ecosystem. </p><blockquote><p>“...it may be irresponsible not to in­clude some exposure to bitcoin giv­en the asymmetric re­turn properties. Even if you don’t get the under­ly­ing cypher­punk and lib­er­tar­i­an ideals, which I find most in­ter­est­ing, you still need to con­sid­er the po­ten­tial di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion ben­e­fits of bit­coin: ‘Schmuck in­sur­ance’ in the words of So­cial Cap­i­tal’s Chamath Pal­i­hapitiya.” </p></blockquote><p>As the bitcoin market cap grows in size and liquidity, along with the fact that it has been the best performing asset of the last 10, five, three and single years, it is no longer acceptable to hold a 0 percent allocation in a portfolio. In a reinforcing feedback loop, the probability of bitcoin emerging as the dominant global monetary system increases the larger it becomes, and more investors like Røkke are taking notice. </p><h2>Turning Challenges To Opportunities</h2><blockquote><p>“I was skeptical of bit­coin for many years and my ar­gu­ments were more or less con­sis­tent with every­one else’s: the network’s elec­tric­i­ty con­sump­tion is waste­ful, the net­work is not scal­able, its ideals of anonymi­ty play into the hands of crim­i­nals, and so on.” </p></blockquote><p>Røkke went into detail and swiftly addressed why these common arguments made by Bitcoin skeptics are in most cases naive and ill informed. In particular, Røkke’s comments on the utility of Bitcoin mining were especially meaningful, given Aker ASA’s broad endeavors in the energy industry. </p><blockquote><p>“The fi­nanciers of min­ing op­er­a­tions will in­sist on us­ing the cheap­est en­er­gy and so by de­f­i­n­i­tion it will be elec­tric­i­ty that has no bet­ter eco­nom­ic use. Bitcoin then acts like an economic battery. What otherwise was of lit­tle value locally, is turned into an economic as­set that can be used glob­al­ly.” </p></blockquote><p>The letter also addresses the potential of the Lightning Network to empower billions across the global economic system, the possibilities of micropayments with a digital bearer asset and the applications that arise as a result, comparisons to gold as a monetary asset, the power of digital network effects, the “bond fire” coming to debt markets and much more.</p>","summary":"In announcing bitcoin-focused company Seetee to shareholders of Aker ASA, billionaire Kjell Inge Røkke made a notably bullish case for BTC.","date_published":"2021-03-08T19:20:24.000Z","author":{"name":"Dylan LeClair"}},{"guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/paypal-to-acquire-digital-asset-custody-provider-curv","url":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/paypal-to-acquire-digital-asset-custody-provider-curv","title":"PayPal To Acquire Digital Asset Custody Provider Curv","content_html":"<p class=\"subtitle\">Payments giant PayPal will be acquiring digital asset custody provider Curv as it strengthens its new cryptocurrency services.</p><!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Today, digital payments giant <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paypal-to-acquire-curv-301242347.html\">PayPal announced the acquisition of Curv</a>, a digital asset security infrastructure and custody company based in Tel Aviv, Israel. </p><p>The acquisition of Curv, founded in 2018, should help the company’s security as it allows customers to buy, sell and hold cryptocurrencies directly on the platform, an addition of services <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/paypal-introduces-ability-to-buy-sell-and-hold-bitcoin\">announced in October 2020</a>.</p><p>“As a pioneer in security infrastructure for digital assets, Curv is proud to be recognized as an innovator and trusted partner to leading financial institutions around the world,” Curv CEO Itay Malinger said in a PayPal announcement. “Now, as the adoption of digital assets accelerates, we feel there's no better home than PayPal to continue our journey of innovation.

Even the Marathon CEO stated in a recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mokamoto/status/1363509810944122882?s=20\">tweet</a>: “Marathon has held Bitcoin we mine and will continue to do so, barring any unforeseen consequences. We also purchased $150m of Bitcoin on 1/25/2021 that is now worth $277m.” On-chain data suggests that it is far from the only mining operation that is thinking this way.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5NDU3NTMyMDE0NjM0OTQ4/unnamed-2.jpg\" height=\"361\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>A final interesting chart to look at is from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Premium. For the first time throughout this entire bull run, the premium has dipped negative, now -11.92 percent, compared to spot bitcoin. Why has the premium turned negative? It’s impossible to say for sure, but it may have something to do with the availability or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as Canada’s <a href=\"http://etf\">Purpose Bitcoin ETF</a>.

But what actually is contango? Why is it important? And how does it affect the price of bitcoin? </p><p>The goal of this piece is to provide you with the answers to these questions, in layman's terms, in addition to explaining how contango accelerates the supply suffocation that is already naturally taking place due to Bitcoin’s programmatic, four-year supply halving. </p><p>(In the chart below, note the sharper-than-normal slope downward in the number of bitcoin of exchanges. In addition to better education/institutional custody of coins, contango is likely playing a part in this.)</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5MzcwMjcxNDMyNTE3NTcy/ddiu_vznzkgkcxavqy9u0eqigg5pexw7cpk2azbvgrkc_gu2g-0shi620ell9s6qs9lr1xrwildcnujregz-p7heph8vbgkbchruvv3xhqfbmek8u8x3rjspsu_h5vvg3rmzv2kv.jpg\" height=\"349\" width=\"620\"></figure><h2>What Is Causing Bitcoin Contango?</h2><p>Before getting into what contango is, I would like to illustrate the macro backdrop of why this phenomenon is able to take place. It is first important to understand that asset prices are inversely correlated to risk-free yields, higher yields equal lower equity valuations (and vice versa). As risk-free, fixed-income instruments (U.S. Treasury bonds) sell-off, yields rise; as they are bought, yields are driven down. In a free and open market, this effect reaches equilibrium as yields rise/lower in correspondence to what the free market agrees upon. </p><p>However, this is not the case any longer with U.S. Treasury bonds. Due to decades of poor monetary policy decision making, particularly since 2008, the entire financial system is extremely fragile. The U.S. Federal Reserve is now manipulating fixed-income yields directly by buying its own treasury bonds. By buying treasuries, thus pinning the yields used in financial valuations down, this creates manipulated growth in legacy asset markets, such as the stock market. Following the decoupling of the U.S. dollar from gold in 1971, the Fed began to use the tool of manipulating yields to create the illusion of growth. </p><p>(This can be illustrated in the chart below, showing the 10-Year treasury bond in particular.)</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5MzcwMjg0MDQ4OTg0MDA0/unnamed.png\" height=\"239\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>If the Federal Reserve were to stop buying treasuries and pinning their yields down, the free market would blow them out, thus causing the collapse of asset prices. Therefore, the Fed has no other choice but to continue buying treasuries to keep the system afloat. Similar to a spring, at this point, the whole system has been coiled so tightly that the unpinning of risk-free yields would cause havoc in markets.</p><h2>The New Bitcoin “Risk-Free” Yield</h2><p>In the bitcoin market, futures are trading at a substantial premium to spot market price. Why these futures are trading at a premium is currently unknown, as there is no storage cost; which is the reason commodity futures traditionally trade at a premium. There are two likely explanations for the premium: the ease of access to leverage through futures markets, or that certain entities are unable to get exposure to bitcoin price appreciation via spots, so they have to buy at a premium through futures markets. I suspect that the premium is more likely caused by the former. Although the exact reason behind why these spreads exist isn’t fully understood, they do exist and are there to be captured. </p><p>(The chart below illustrates the dramatic increase in futures open interest.)</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5MzcwMjk2Mzk3MDE0OTgw/unnamed-1.png\" height=\"349\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>To arbitrage and capture the difference between spot and futures prices, a financial entity can simultaneously go long/short, giving them a yield that is essentially risk- ree. For example, an August CME futures contract is priced at $54,105, while the current spot price on Coinbase is $50,905. By simultaneously buying spot for $50,905 and going short via futures, a financial entity can pocket the $3,205, or 6 percent return, over five months, given they hold these positions until the August expiry. On an annualized basis, this is a 14.4 percent yield, nearly risk-free; dramatically higher than the current one-year U.S. Treasury bond, which yields .08 percent. In addition, as the bitcoin price appreciates and becomes more volatile, there will be even fatter spreads to arbitrage through this method. </p><h2>Over Collateralization</h2><p>We have discussed the method by which one could arbitrage the spreads in bitcoin spots/futures, but now I’d like to illustrate how the increasing popularity of this trade will accelerate the supply suffocation already naturally occurring via Bitcoin’s programmatic, four-year halving cycle. </p><p>The accelerant is over-collateralization, which is unique to bitcoin lending/borrowing markets. For physically-settled futures contracts, an entity must borrow BTC from a lending platform such as BlockFi in order to sell bitcoin short and take on the long/short trade described in the paragraph above. Due to bitcoin’s volatility, these bitcoin lending platforms require that the borrower must post twice whatever they are borrowing in collateral to BlockFi, or in other words, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of a loan is 50 percent. </p><p>For example, if I were to borrow $50 to sell bitcoin short, I would need to post $100-worth of collateral to the lending platform. To reduce counterparty risk, BlockFi then takes that collateral posted and turns it into bitcoin to be held in escrow until the borrower pays back the loan. Given the 50 percent LTV we mentioned above, this means that there are two bitcoin being locked in escrow for every one bitcoin that would naturally be removed from supply. </p><p>As spreads increase and the arbitrage opportunity becomes more attractive, this effect will accelerate, causing increasing amounts of bitcoin to be locked up. It will be extremely interesting to see how this plays out, as there has never been a mature derivatives market and lending/borrowing market in previous bitcoin bull cycles. This effect could be the catalyst for bitcoin to reach escape velocity. Taking a look at futures volume/open interest in comparison to balance on exchanges, the two seem to have an inverse correlation, possibly illustrating growing interest in the opportunity to capture yield spreads and the over-collateralization of borrowed coins required for the trade.</p><p>(The charts below represent futures volume, futures open interest, and balance on exchanges.)</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5MzcwMzEwODkyNTI5NjA0/unnamed.jpg\" height=\"345\" width=\"620\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5MzcwMzEwODkyNjYwNjc2/unnamed-2.png\" height=\"349\" width=\"620\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5MzcwMzEwODkyNTk1MTQw/unnamed-3.png\" height=\"349\" width=\"620\"></figure><h2>Asset Price Revaluations And The Endgame Of Contango</h2><p>As touched on at the beginning of this article, asset prices are inversely correlated to risk-free yields. As of right now, the average price-to-earnings (PE) Ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is just above 34. This may seem astronomical, but in comparison to current treasury yields, it makes sense. As a rule of thumb, equity returns should equal a PE ratio of one. The expected return on an equity with a PE ratio of 34 would be 2.94 percent, which is still far more attractive than ten-year treasuries that currently yield 1.47 percent. </p><p>However, if the market begins to recognize the growing yields that exist in the bitcoin market as the new risk-free rate used to determine valuations, there could be a dramatic repricing of assets. For example, if bitcoin yields were to blow out to 20 percent, PE ratios would need to be well below five in order for risk-on equities to offer a more attractive return than that 20 percent risk-free rate. If the average price-to-earnings ratios were to drop from 34 to five, that would be an 85.29 percent stock market correction. In addition, there is also the $128 trillion yield-deprived, fixed-income market to consider as well. </p><p>These new bitcoin risk-free yields that aren’t possible in the current manipulated, fixed-income market could be the catalyst to release the pressure built up in the monetary “spring” that has been coiling up for decades, with nowhere for that monetary energy to flow until now, into these free and open bitcoin markets. </p><p>To conclude, with these new “risk-free” bitcoin yields attracting increasingly more of the $128 trillion of monetary energy from fixed income, financial instruments denominated in an eroding currency (USD), that the rest of the business world stops using to conduct economic calculation, would be dramatically impaired. Eventually, post-hyperbitcoinization, it would be attractive to rotate bitcoin back into equities and other assets, once their valuations are more attractive in comparison to the returns that the arbitrage yields offer.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by William Clemente III.

Our current monetary system, the U.S. dollar, is based entirely on an ever-growing mountain of debt. In contrast, the Bitcoin monetary system is equity-based, with no counterparty risk and no dilution risk.</p><p>Once the world has completely embraced bitcoin as the superior monetary good, we will be living in a post-hyperbitcoinization world. Let’s experiment and see how a company will be valued using bitcoin as our unit of account or measuring stick of value.</p><h2>Wyoming Red Ribeyes</h2><p>The fictional company we will use for this example is Wyoming Red Ribeyes. It is a small cap, consumer staples, wholesale beef supplier that raises cattle and then sells premium beef to grocery stores in the U.S.</p><p>We will analyze this company with a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. Put simply, we attempt to predict the future cash flows the business will generate, and discount those cash flows to today’s value.</p><p>Two DCF models are created. One model is analyzing the company in a world where prices are driven by USD-denominated investors (today), and the other model is analyzing the company in a world where prices are driven by BTC-denominated investors (post-hyperbitcoinization).</p><h2>USD-Denominated Model (Pre-Hyperbitcoinization)</h2><p>Before we create the full model, we need to lay out our assumptions.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5MzkyOTM4MTIyNDIxNTgx/rd2mxv6zcmtcl4hdttobljtt9kvrbc3kvb-iojnxgr4qb83szwnvohj_jsecmp11tkyae5cfvjj47xlpjn_s7k33eprrmxwhic8qk45emir8ptizedivnyo80g6u-sfngkdoivg0.png\" height=\"533\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>First, let’s assume the current variable cost per ribeye produced is $5, and the price that Wyoming Red Ribeyes sell it for is $10. Based on previous years’ sales, we expect 10 million ribeyes to be sold this year. Other expenses, including selling, general and administrative expenses, historically equal about 25 percent of annual revenue. </p><p>Additionally, we expect its unit costs to rise 2 percent per year (consumer price index inflation), and it will pass that on to its customers by raising our prices 2 percent per year. It also expects to increase the number of ribeyes sold by 2 percent per year, as U.S. beef consumption is steadily growing. </p><p>Last, Wyoming Red Ribeyes expects to sell the business in 10 years at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio multiple of 25 (the S&amp;P 500 Consumer Staples average), and it will discount its projected future cash flows back to today’s value using the company’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as its discount rate. This company is financed with 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity, with a cost of debt equaling 100 basis points (bps) above the risk-free rate (based on a 10-year treasury note) and an equity risk premium of 5 percent.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5MzkyOTUxNTQ0MTk1MDEy/unnamed-4.png\" height=\"288\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>Above is the USD DCF model (hiding years four to nine for display purposes). Three things are very notable: One, we can see that revenue starts at $100 million and continues to grow over time. Two, earnings start at $25 million and also continue to grow over time. And three, the implied market cap is just below $1 billion.</p><h2>BTC-Denominated Model (Post-Hyperbitcoinization)</h2><p>Before we create the full model, we need to lay out our updated assumptions since all prices will now be denominated in bitcoin.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5MzkyOTYyMjgxNjEyNjIx/fddt2zyqoa-kfelc3xq3k2wwsu8ud0ore8o_u81zyu1nf32s9ohxvpmty2vlqrf86iqqtsymighflttaualqawcmt7hp_r4qrxmavknkaoewi89tw1plrb7w7fs4tu6vkqhkhrgp.png\" height=\"459\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>First, we updated the unit cost to be 50 sats and the price at which Wyoming Red Ribeyes sells a unit to be 100 sats. This corresponds to roughly $5 and $10, respectively, at $10 million per BTC. Based on previous years’ sales, Wyoming Red Ribeyes still expects 10 million ribeyes to be sold this year. Other expenses, including selling, general and administrative expenses, historically equal about 25 percent of annual revenue. It is possible that this percentage would be decreasing over time, but for simplicity, we’ve kept it stagnant.</p><p>Unlike in our USD-denominated analysis, Wyoming Red Ribeyes can anticipate both its costs and its prices to decline by 5 percent annually. This is due to bitcoin’s natural deflationary nature allocating productivity gains to bitcoin savers. These productivity gains could be from an infinite amount of sources, including: automated energy production; self-driving delivery trucks; automated packaging and distribution; automated feeding, breeding and slaughter processes; or new software driving other unforeseen enhancements.</p><p>Last, Wyoming Red Ribeyes expects to sell the business in 10 years at a P/E multiple of seven, and we will discount our projected future cash flows back to today’s value using the expected equity risk premium under a Bitcoin standard, 10 percent. The P/E ratio is expected to be around seven and the discount rate is expected to be around 10 percent in order to better compensate the risk that the investor is taking relative to the new opportunity cost of simply HODLing bitcoin. The discount rate could possibly be higher and the P/E could possibly be lower.</p><figure><img src=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5MzkyOTgzNzU2NDQ5MTAx/icgp9ym-bxfgkqk6vkquuufptp5ncu9dimvt98jelm0th3qsxm2oyp-ondajfjxg0iyt9bag5q8lncgw_zfku2qciegyydhghlgfhp0ebsdm2mxfg2pc_wf1sckciuzb8xe_zqvy.png\" height=\"333\" width=\"620\"></figure><p>Above is the BTC DCF model (hiding years four to nine for display purposes). Four things are very notable: One, we can see that revenue starts at 10 BTC and continues to decline over time. Two, earnings start at 2.5 BTC and also continue to decline over time. Three, the implied market cap is just above 20 BTC. And four, and most notably, the real USD equivalent market cap is less than one-fourth the valuation in the USD-denominated world.</p><h2>Bitcoin Swallows “Store Of Value”</h2><p>As you might have expected, this massive drawdown in (real) valuation is simply taking the “store of value” aspect out of the equities, since that value will be stored entirely in bitcoin. However, it may be better to think that equities won’t fall in (real) value, but instead the amount of actual savings in the economy must increase by multiple orders of magnitude. I.e., the value per bitcoin must go very high.</p><p>Ultimately, bitcoin HODLers will be the ones who price equities in a bitcoin world, and they will be the ones who determine at what equity risk premiums they are willing to part ways with their bitcoin. The types of companies and projects that get funded in a bitcoin world will be high value, low time preference endeavours, as that will be the only way to obtain positive free cash flow.</p><p>The high equity risk premium doesn’t necessarily mean that fewer projects will be funded. It is likely that the value of bitcoin will rise so high that large HODLers will have so much wealth to fund all sorts of interesting ventures, while still retaining a significant amount of their BTC as savings.</p><p>Bitcoin will usher in a new era of price discovery for markets by eliminating government and central bank intervention, obliterating the idea of debt and allocating all risk free “store of value” wealth to bitcoin. It is likely that the amount of wealth humans will be willing to store in a risk free “store of value” asset with no counterparty risk and no dilution risk is incomprehensible.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Mimesis Capital.

A key part of this project is the Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI), a Bitcoin Core-compatible program designed to communicate with a range of hardware wallets.</p><p>Provoost explained how Bitcoin Core and HWI are slowly getting more closely integrated. Until now, HWI could already be used in combination with Bitcoin Core by having users copy/paste data between the two programs. This will now be automated in the next Bitcoin Core release, at least for command line users. The next step will be to also use hardware wallets from Bitcoin Core's graphical user interface.</p><p>Finally, the hosts discussed some alternative solutions to use hardware wallets in combination with full node security, like the Specter wallet.</p>","summary":"In this episode of \"The Van Wirdum Sjorsnado,\" the hosts discussed hardware wallet integration into Bitcoin Core and Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI).","date_published":"2021-03-05T21:09:25.000Z","author":{"name":"Bitcoin Magazine"}},{"guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-company-cipher-mining-to-go-public-via-spac-valued-at-2-billion","url":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-company-cipher-mining-to-go-public-via-spac-valued-at-2-billion","title":"Bitcoin Mining Company Cipher Mining To Go Public Via SPAC, Valued At $2 Billion","content_html":"<p class=\"subtitle\">Bitfury subsidiary Cipher Mining Technologies is merging with Global Acquisition Group and going public on Nasdaq.</p><!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210305005234/en/Cipher-Mining-Inc.-a-Newly-Formed-US-based-Bitcoin-Mining-Company-to-Become-a-Publicly-Traded-Company-via-a-Merger-with-Good-Works-Acquisition-Corp\">Cipher Mining Technologies announced</a> that it plans to go public via a merger with Good Work Acquisition Corp.

Bitcoin is the world’s first investment megatrend in which retail investors have led institutional allocators. And, until the advent of the Great Corona Recession, that dynamic was not given much consideration by the investment banks, hedge funds and asset management titans. </p><p>The rapidity and magnitude of the bounce in equities and risk assets in March of last year was caused in large part by the new force that retail investors represent in markets, empowered by fresh access to information and markets via online platforms around the world. The recent coordinated targeting of concentrated short-interest stocks by the “<a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/after-gamestop-short-squeeze-r-wallstreetbets-is-ready-for-bitcoin\">Reddit Revolutionaries</a>” was reminiscent of the Arab Spring, where use of social media catalysed regime change. </p><p>The r/wallstreetbets group was similarly well informed and demonstrated its capability to move markets, triggering political uproar and a temporary concern for the structure of the U.S. equity market’s clearing and settlement structure. Retail investors have now permanently affected the asymmetry of short bets in single-stock equities that require traditional “market-neutral” hedge funds and asset managers to deploy more sophisticated strategies and mechanisms for managing risk.</p><h2>Why We’re Living In The Bitcoin Age</h2><p>Bitcoin has exploded due to the confluence of a number of factors. It is “better at being gold than gold” in as much as it is instantly accessible (does not require trust in an intermediary, administrator or appointment at the vault), has a lower cost of carry than bullion and has an absolutely constrained supply of 21 million (whereas advances in refining technology and environmental, social and governance shortcuts can generate more metal). </p><p>The rate of change of balance-sheet expansion at the European Central Bank (ECB), Federal Reserve and other G4 central banks is unprecedented. The “debasement of fiat currency” has moved from being “crypto kid” language to capital markets parlance, adopted by the world’s leading strategists to encompass the decline of the purchasing power of money and fuelling the asset-price inflation across the “Everything Rally.” This spectre of wealth erosion has been a familiar dynamic across many emerging markets, of course, since World War II, where investors and savers have lived with the threat of their wealth disappearing. These conditions have now come to developed markets since the Great Corona Recession, where policy makers can leverage the tools already developed and tested since the Great Financial Crisis — and without having to debate the political moral hazard of being seen to bail out the banks.</p><p>ITI is an emerging, markets-focused multi-asset prime broker. ITI turned bullish on bitcoin in the second quarter of last year when it became apparent across our core markets that the impact of retail investors in equity markets was a global phenomenon, rather than something limited to the U.S. equity market, as widely reported. ITI observed that, increasingly, the global population was turning to investing in markets in desperation to generate a living, rather than the “work-from-home gambling culture” that is often portrayed as fueling bitcoin. </p><p>Then, in the third quarter of last year, bitcoin began to take out the previous December 2017 peak in the currencies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) and other emerging markets. While U.S.-based and European observers debated the question of “will it, won’t it” break $20,000, ITI observed that for hundreds of millions of people around the world, bitcoin already had made a new high in their currencies as they scrambled to protect their savings.</p><p>Another major contributor to the adoption of bitcoin by the establishment has been the personal incentivization for asset managers, investment governance committees and corporate CFOs. Compensation drives behavior in financial markets. In December 2017, it made for stoic fiduciary responsibility to decry crypto as the vector of money-laundering and nefarious activity. This time around, however, that pendulum has swung to the other side whereby professional allocators and wealth managers need to be able to point to the safest way to access bitcoin for equity and multi-asset investment mandates. </p><p>ITI observes that bitcoin <em>is</em> an extension of the emerging markets investment phenomenon. It is also a manifestation of the value of the internet. And hence, it stands to reason that social media and the cult of celebrity have also been driving demand to an extent often misunderstood by traditional asset managers. In recent years, celebrity has been king, epitomised by the ascendancy of the previous U.S. president.</p><p>Bitcoin has become a necessary topic for all those tech-savvy business leaders who have harnessed the network effect to propagate their followings. Elon Musk’s Tesla announced that it had <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/its-happening-tesla-buys-1-5-billion-of-bitcoin\">spent $1.5 billion on bitcoin in January</a>, causing the currency to surge 17 percent in value. This news arrived just days after Musk <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/after-elon-musk-changes-twitter-bio-to-bitcoin-btc-price-surges\">added ‘#bitcoin’ to his Twitter profile page</a> — only to replace it with “<a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/are-elon-musks-dogecoin-tweets-misdirections-or-just-bad-jokes\">Dogecoin</a>” shortly thereafter, which heightened the volatility for several days. Tesla also acknowledged future plans to accept bitcoin as payment for its products, which, quite significantly, has contributed toward Bitcoin’s mainstream acceptance.</p><h2>The “Celebrity” Dynamic</h2><p>Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, is the most influential American in Bitcoin. His company, a two-decade veteran of the Nasdaq, currently holds the <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/why-investors-are-so-excited-about-microstrategys-bitcoin-acquisition-plan\">largest corporate allocation to bitcoin in the world</a>.</p><p>The reason that Musk and Saylor have had such an impact on Bitcoin is because of their credentials to back up their rationales and bold positioning. Musk is one of the world’s richest people, making him a leading authority on successful endeavours. His actions have not just increased the number of retail investors looking to make a short-term fortune on the volatile digital currency, but it’s made bitcoin a far more attractive option for both corporate, institutional and traditional investors, which less than six months ago would not have gone near bitcoin.</p><p>The difference between Musk’s tongue-in-cheek backing of dogecoin and his support for bitcoin is that Tesla put its treasury reserves into bitcoin. And, in doing so, Tesla joined a long list of tech giants who have already embraced cryptocurrency: Mastercard, Home Depot, Wikipedia and AT&amp;T all accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment, and arguably the world’s most recognizable tech brand, Microsoft, has been accepting bitcoin for use in its online Xbox store since 2014 (with a short pause).</p><p>Thus, Tesla’s acceptance of bitcoin lent more weight to the long-term success of bitcoin than any public tweet from Musk could. At the time of this writing, rumors of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-apple-idUSKBN2A82I4\">Apple’s introduction to the cryptocurrency space</a> are gaining momentum.</p><p>With the economic strife and devaluation of fiat currencies caused by quantitative easing by central banks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s no surprise at all that retail and corporate investors alike are rushing to invest in bitcoin. Celebrity appraisal of this fact has, for the most part, done little more than attract even more attention to the digital currency.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Stephen Kelso.

But Bitcoin now offers a beacon of hope.</p><!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>The separation of money and state is the most important change to society ever. Why? Let’s rewind the clock and find out.</p><h2>Church And State</h2><p>Throughout recorded history, religion and power have been inexorably linked. The collective belief in one or more divine entities is very powerful. It enables humans to form larger groups than other primates. </p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number\">Dunbar’s number</a> represents how many people with whom one can maintain relationships. Without collective beliefs, human tribes could not have exceeded this number. Thus, civilization needs a belief system at its core. Belief systems provide human leaders with motivational tools. The introduction of ceremonial burial was one such tool. With ceremonial burial came the promise of an afterlife. This tool enabled tribal leaders to start wars with other tribes. Other primates fight each other too, of course, but outright war is a different thing. War has a supposed purpose for the collective. </p><p>Despots could now trick their subjects with the promise of a better life after this one. This gave them immense power, since they could now rally armies to further their causes. It enabled them to form nation states. Controlled territories with loyal citizens living in fear of the armed forces. Because of people’s beliefs, the divine right of the ruler became a part of their operating system. For centuries, this was the basis of governance for almost all nations. The rulers' supposed closer connection to the gods legitimized them in the eyes of the people.</p><p>Then, the colonization of the Americas introduced a new problem for the ruling class: People from different religious backgrounds needed to band together in the new states. </p><p>Enter the ideas of English philosopher John Locke. Locke argued that the realm of individual conscience was a personal thing. Thus, the liberty of conscience had to remain protected from any government authority. Locke’s ideas had a huge influence on America’s founding fathers. Religious tolerance became the norm in the new world. Thomas Jefferson <a href=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-i#:~:text=Congress%20shall%20make%20no%20law,for%20a%20redress%20of%20grievances.\">wrote that</a> the government should “make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”</p><p>These ideas made their way into the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. You know, the one about protecting freedom of thought and expression. Similar developments were happening throughout Europe. Today, almost all Western democracies call themselves “secular states.” Freedom of thought propelled humanity forward in unprecedented ways. Claiming that the earth revolved around the sun wasn't a crime any more. The dogmatic thinking of the church was no longer a burden on scientific progress. The ideas of the Enlightenment had finally emerged victorious. Humanity had abandoned superstition. The elites could no longer fool people into submission with their lies. Or could they?</p><h2>Money And State</h2><p>The institutions of the church and the state were no longer dependent on each other, true. But religious traditions were still dictating how these states operated. The Gregorian calendar remained in use and Sundays remained somewhat sacred. So did Christian holidays like Christmas and Easter. Ceremonial burial is everywhere. An alien would most likely find the practice very odd. But most important of all, the belief in the state itself remained. For what maintains the state if not religious belief? What gives one man the right to govern another? Aren’t these notions mere remnants of an antiquated belief system? </p><p>Some of us think they are. Some of us see no difference between the allegiance to God and the justification of a government. The most powerful tool of lulling people into a specific set of beliefs that exists today is money. With the introduction of fiat currencies came a new way of controlling populations. New methods to keep them enslaved. The central bank proved to be a much more powerful entity than the church could ever be. The thought of a better life after this one could make regular people do atrocious things to each other. The thought of a better life here and now could make people do atrocious things to themselves. It enslaved them in perpetuous work, as they all strived to become rich — an impossible goal for most people.</p><p>As long as there are money printers, there can be no freedom of expression. Money is the tool we use to express value to each other. Whoever controls the money supply controls the world. The words “In God We Trust,” printed on every dollar bill in existence, gives a clue to how fooled we’ve been. We’re not secular. We still belong to a cult. The emperors are still naked. There’s still no such thing as divine right. </p><p>If we want to become secular, we have to separate money and state. There’s no middle ground here. People in charge of issuing currency can't resist enriching themselves. The incentives are too strong. There’s no way around this. Never trust a piece of paper that says \"In God We Trust.\" There's probably no God and definitely no \"we.\" </p><p>But, since 2009, we have had Bitcoin. A beacon of hope in an otherwise dark world. A peaceful way of disarming the sociopaths. A way of making violence a lot less effective. If you want your mind to be free, rid yourself of all appeals to authority. Take control of your destiny. Emancipate yourself. Don’t let anyone dictate the course of your life.</p><p>Amen.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Knut Svanholm.

As we approach new levels of adoption and usage, we will naturally form groups, categories and units. The structure of our operations and expansion will, of course, be decentralized in origin. But while these organizational pieces will be inherently \"institutional,\" the actual effect they have on the network will not be restrictive. They won't limit or control the Bitcoin network, as many of the current financial institutions act as chokepoints and limited-access custodians.</p><p>Rather, these groups will only bolster the strength of the network, as they are formed out of economic incentive and natural market forces, rather than politics, as so much of the current financial system is. They will represent a diversity of people natural to an open-source, unbiased computer program. </p><p>In a Bitcoin world, decisions are not made on the basis of who you know or where you come from, but on what you know and how you got here.</p><blockquote><p>\"When they put their petty differences aside... they beat everybody else.\"</p><p>-Michael Saylor, “The Saylor Series”</p></blockquote><p>I don't see too many petty differences in the Bitcoin community. Some would argue the opposite, but I think taking a broader perspective will present one with a well-communicated, intricately-interconnected network. What appear as memes and meta-jokes can be interpreted as a social group operating on the language of the internet; the <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/after-gamestop-short-squeeze-r-wallstreetbets-is-ready-for-bitcoin\">recent events surrounding GameStop</a> demonstrate the efficacy of this. No longer do these comedic representations of life exist only on the fringe of reality, but as mainstream communicative media.</p><p>The organization of Bitcoin will happen at a financial-institution level, all the way down to a personal-household level. In regards to such a large paradigm shift, one can expect to experience a reorganization of every aspect of society. Just consider how society right now orients itself around money; now imagine the entire fabric and identity of that money having been absolutely changed. It is difficult to conceive of the nature of the changes, but it would be reasonable to expect them to be large.</p><p>The most interesting aspect about Bitcoiners is that, unlike the Romans, a state need not organize us. We simply organize ourselves, as economically directed, to our most organic state. Where we find our niche and skills, we find economic reward, and in a society founded upon sound money, this reward compels further pursuit of passion. Freedom on this level could only have been dreamt of by Libertarians past — the Founding Fathers themselves could not have foreseen it.</p><p>How lucky we are to experience it. And what a wondrous reward: the scarcest money ever known to man. The price of a bitcoin is misleading — the value of Bitcoin the network is entirely unknowable. As anyone who understands Bitcoin may simply tell you, it is the value of everything.</p><p>Having such a coveted reward in front of us, we should feel a desire and necessity to organize. It will bolster the network's defenses, foster community and promote growth and excellence within the space. </p><p>When I first encountered Bitcoin in my early teenage years, there was naught but a fringe community of internet forums surrounding it. It wasn't until an entire community had been built, creating the social fabric of a network that was necessary to draw more attraction and attention to it, that I would begin to find interest in Bitcoin. You see, much like many other things in this world, formulation of groups and coalescing of peoples attracts more people. We naturally are compelled to join what others deemed interesting enough to examine.</p><p>So, it is of the utmost importance that we continue to grow our organizational networks, as well as polish these organizations into intriguing and intellectually stimulating harbors of knowledge.</p><p>Indeed, Bitcoin is better shared with others. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Casey.

The moment was both historic and telling. It was also incredibly sweet. Bitcoin has not only proved doubters like <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-paul-krugmans-problem-bitcoin/\">Paul Krugman</a> wrong, it continues to grow in influence and importance. 2021 may very well prove to be the year that bitcoin becomes death, destroyer of fiat.</p><p>The $50,000 mark was especially sweet because Satoshi’s creation has been misdiagnosed for years. If French philosopher Michel Foucault, a man who knew a thing or two about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-psychiatry\">misdiagnoses</a>, was around today, what would he have to say about Bitcoin?</p><h2>Finding Foucault</h2><p>As a divisive figure, for every fan of the Frenchman, a detractor exists. Does Foucault deserve a place in the pantheon of great thinkers? American literary theorist Leo Bersani certainly thinks so. He <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1981/03/15/michel-foucault-philosopher-of-power/3cc27899-6c0f-4b60-a8a5-007e112ef9ae/\">considers</a> Foucault to be a most “brilliant philosopher,” more original “than any other contemporary thinker.” On the other hand, American philosopher Noam Chomsky famously <a href=\"https://www.openculture.com/2019/06/michel-foucault-and-noam-chomsky-debate-human-nature-power-on-dutch-tv-1971.html\">called</a> Foucault “totally amoral,” prone to the wildest of exaggerations. </p><p>The truth, one imagines, lies somewhere in the middle. </p><p>Though I agree with Chomsky to some degree, Foucault’s ideas are both provocative and engaging. And, more often than not, they carry a great degree of truth.</p><p>A proponent of self-governance, Foucault abhorred the idea of bureaucratic overreach. He was especially critical of political and psychiatric establishments. Members of the latter, he believed, were in the business of misdiagnosing and forcibly confining anyone who dared stray from the prescribed path. He warned against a system of diagnosis that could be manipulated for political purposes. Who, he asked, was doing the diagnosing? Were they to be trusted? Were their intentions pure? How “sane” were they?</p><h2>The Foucauldian Perspective On Bitcoin</h2><p>How, exactly, can a Foucauldian perspective be applied to the world of Bitcoin?</p><p>Well, for more than a decade, members of the establishment have been misdiagnosing BTC. It has been called every economic epithet imaginable: Ponzi scheme, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/economist-bitcoin-is-a-pyramid-scheme-204217615.html\">pyramid</a> scheme, bubble (about <a href=\"https://www.publish0x.com/j-mac/red-pills-blue-pills-and-bitcoin-bubbles-xlyqdpd\">400 times</a>), etc. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/05/warren-buffett-says-bitcoin-is-probably-rat-poison-squared.html\">Warren Buffet called it rat poison</a>. <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/bitcoin-is-a-fools-gold-peter-schiff\">Peter Schiff thinks it’s fool’s gold</a>.</p><p>History is littered with the misdiagnoses of individuals and ideas. The labelers tend to come in two forms: the first, too ignorant to understand; the second, understanding fully and genuinely perturbed by the possibilities. Once considered aberrational by those in power, we now see many of these ideas and individuals for what they truly were (and still are): revolutionary. </p><p>From Einstein to Eminem, innovative thinkers have always faced backlash from those in positions in power. When the former published his theory of relativity, a number of prominent scientists vehemently <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Physik\">dismissed</a> it as “Jewish physics.” </p><p>The latter, when he first burst onto the scene in the ’90s, was considered a grave threat to society. His lyrics, many argued, would inspire anarchy in the streets. In reality, they inspired two phenomenal albums and a number of highly forgettable ones. </p><p>Bitcoin has also faced a host of wild accusations. In 2013, the economist John Quiggin <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/commentary/the-bitcoin-bubble-bad-hypothesis-8353\">called</a> BTC “the most demonstrably valueless financial asset ever created.\"</p><p>The three examples listed here show how the world tends to react to unorthodox ideas. First, there is shock, quickly followed by criticism, often extreme in nature. However, if the ideas happen to be of high quality, they stick. In fact, they grow, they mature and they gain acceptance. In the case of Einstein, his ideas infiltrated the cultural psyche, redefining the way in which many of us see the world. Bitcoin, too, appears to be on a similar, upward trajectory.</p><h2>Committed To Change</h2><p>A champion of heterodox thinking, Foucault was a powerful orator. He encouraged freedom of expression and a willingness to be bold. He <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1529842-curiosity-evokes-concern-it-evokes-the-care-one-takes-for\">dreamt of a</a> “new age of curiosity,” a day in which traditional “familiarities” faced the greatest levels of scrutiny. Foucault encouraged dissent, especially if the dissent resulted in a change for the better.</p><p>In order for progress to occur, society benefits from what the comedian Bryan Callen calls “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq7IIMgzxlY\">idea sex</a>.” One person has an idea, another person has an idea (often very different in nature), with these two ideas coming together to create an <em>idea baby</em> of sorts. </p><p>Greatness doesn’t come from comfort; it comes from disruption. George Carlin knew this. Steve Jobs knew this. And Michael Foucault most definitely knew this.</p><p>The controversial theorist encouraged his followers to be more independent, to be brave and to challenge authority. Be a critical thinker, not a passive receptacle, he preached. Instead of blindly accepting traditional norms, question them, question their origins. If you are perturbed by the answers you find, let the discomfort be a catalyst for change. </p><p>If one substitutes Satoshi’s name for Foucault’s in the above paragraph, those sentences still make complete sense. The Bitcoin philosophy and the Foucauldian approach are cut from the very same cloth. As the academic Dr. Mary Klages <a href=\"https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~sflores/klagesfoucault.html\">writes</a>, Foucault was “the founder of his own school of thought.” Satoshi, in many ways, also founded his own “school” of thought. </p><p>Foucault said it was his job to <a href=\"https://postphilosophy.medium.com/foucaults-confession-139f10bcb5c5#:~:text=2%20min%20read-,%E2%80%9CI%27m%20no%20prophet.,off%20acting%20in%20shampoo%20commercials.&amp;text=When%20Foucault%20finished%20installing%20windows,the%20manor%20about%20installation%20fees.\">make</a> “windows where there were once walls.” Now, I ask, is there a better way of describing the Bitcoin philosophy?</p><p><em>This is a guest post by J.

The ban from the country’s central bank won’t change that.</p><!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Back in 2017, the idea of Bitcoin in Nigeria was an interesting one that generally got the attention of two main categories of people: the early adopters with an interest in emerging technologies and the “hustlers” that are always on the lookout for new ways to make money. The latter category consisted of the same people that turned to the Mavrodi Mundial Movement (MMM), <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/14/africa/mmm-ponzi-scheme-nigeria/index.html\">one of the world’s largest Ponzi scheme</a>, when it became popular in 2016. </p><p>Unfortunately, the average Nigerian has struggled greatly in the country’s current economy, and many have been forced to seek out alternatives that offered tangible opportunities to make money. When cryptocurrency exchanges started to show up in Nigeria, they made <a href=\"https://www.yellowcard.io\">buying and selling bitcoin</a> more convenient for these categories of people, because the alternative was to buy bitcoin from a stranger with no assurance of getting what you paid for. And, as a result, the country’s cryptocurrency community began to grow.</p><h2>Bitcoin’s Rise In Nigeria</h2><p>The booming cryptocurrency market in Nigeria today has come a long way from those early days as the adoption rate in Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, keeps growing year after year. A major reason for the exponential growth of the Nigerian cryptocurrency community can be linked to the country’s predominantly young population — it is significantly more tech-savvy than its parents, and it has taken to the internet in hopes of finding jobs and income that often prove fleeting at home.</p><p>Understandably, the young population went digital in its pursuit of a better life. Many younger Nigerians became freelancers in their chosen fields and started offering their services to the international community where their work is valued. But, once again, the challenge of getting paid for their work because of their location was difficult. In the same vein, Nigerians in the diaspora also experienced a similar challenge when sending money back home, as exorbitant charges from foreign banks and money transfer companies discouraged many from doing so.</p><p>Meanwhile, things kept getting worse for the average Nigerian, with the naira experiencing incessant inflation, making the country’s fiat a poor store of value; traditional banks charging ridiculous fees for simple transactions; and a rise in the unemployment rate. In the midst of all of these issues, the gospel of Bitcoin kept spreading as the foremost cryptocurrency’s major features made it look like it was specifically designed to save Nigerians.</p><h2>Why Bitcoin Is Successful In Nigeria</h2><p>Bitcoin’s decentralized features, its ability to furnish cheaper and faster transactions and its rising value ultimately turned the attention of many Nigerians to it, so that in a 2020 COVID-19 halted world, Bitcoin had finally found a home in Nigeria. And this reflected in the numbers, as our <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerias-yellow-card-processes-165-million-in-crypto-remittances-so-far-this-year/\">cryptocurrency exchange, Yellow Card, processed over $200 million</a> in cryptocurrency volume in 2020, with most of that volume coming from Nigeria. Blockchain.com also reported that there was an <a href=\"https://medium.com/blockchain/the-great-mother-of-all-financial-crises-83c8f73328f2\">increase from Nigeria</a> in the number of new Bitcoin wallets created on its platform.</p><p>Bitcoin offered the glimmer of hope that many Nigerians desperately needed as they could finally see the chance of attaining financial freedom to be more likely than ever. And, in the following ways, Bitcoin has become successful in Nigeria:</p><ol><li>As a store of value: The naira’s continuous inflation has made many lose confidence in keeping their hard-earned money in fiat. Bitcoin offers a better alternative as its adoption across the world increases, thus driving up its demand and, consequently, its price.</li><li>As a better investment alternative: Many Nigerians have turned to trading and investing in bitcoin as a form of passive income and, despite the cryptocurrency’s volatile nature, the returns over time have seen many become millionaires.</li><li>As an enabler of easy transactions: The sending and receiving of money across the border for the payment of goods and services, or to loved ones, has never been easier with bitcoin, thanks to its cheaper network rate and faster transfer time than traditional remittance systems.</li></ol><p>While a <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/nigerians-need-bitcoin-so-where-will-the-restrictions-lead\">recent directive from the nation’s apex bank</a> reiterating that regulated financial institutions are not authorized to offer services to cryptocurrency exchanges, the interest in Bitcoin has only continued to grow in the country as, coincidentally, institutional investments have propelled the price of bitcoin past $57,000, as of the third week of February. </p><p>It is, therefore, no longer a matter of <em>if</em> Bitcoin will continue to bloom in Nigeria, but a matter of <em>how long</em> before it reaches everyone in the country. The Central Bank of Nigeria’s directive may take some exchanges in the country offline for the time being, but peer-to-peer transactions, which have always been an extremely popular and active trading method in Nigeria, will only grow more quickly.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Joel Ogunjimi and Chris Maurice.

Voegtlin wants to be able to prove that the address he paid was actually the address provided to him by the receiver (e.g. an exchange). Charles Hill and Andrew Kozlik each replied with information about protocols they’re working on. Hill’s <a href=\"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018446.html\">scheme</a> is intended for use with <a href=\"https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc\">LNURL</a> but could be repurposed to serve Voegtlin’s intended use case. Kozlik’s <a href=\"https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-February/018448.html\">scheme</a> is closer in spirit to BIP70 but drops its use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509\">X.509 certificates</a> and adds features for exchange-based coin swaps (e.g. trading BTC for an altcoin or vice-versa).</li><li><strong>Fraud proofs in the v0 Discreet Log Contract (DLC) specification:</strong> Thibaut Le Guilly started a <a href=\"https://mailmanlists.org/pipermail/dlc-dev/2021-February/000020.html\">discussion</a> on the DLC-dev mailing list about the <a href=\"https://github.com/discreetlogcontracts/dlcspecs/blob/master/v0Milestone.md#simple-fraud-proofs-in-progress\">goal</a> to include fraud proofs in the version 0 DLC coordination specification. Two types of fraud were discussed:<ul><li><em>Equivocation:</em> where an oracle signs for the same event more than once, producing conflicting results. A proof of equivocation can be automatically verified by software without third-party trust.</li><li><em>Lying:</em> where an oracle signs for an outcome that users know is wrong. This will almost always depend on evidence not available to the user’s contract software, so this type of fraud proof must be verified manually by the user, who can compare the original contract to the outcome signed by the oracle.</li></ul>Discussion participants seemed to all favor providing an equivocation proof, although there was some concern that it could be too much work for the v0 specification. As an intermediate solution, it was suggested to focus on proofs of lying. When the format of those proofs has been established, software can then be updated to take two separate proofs for the same oracle and event to create a proof of equivocation.One concern with proofs of lying was that users could be spammed by fake proofs, forcing users to either waste their time verifying false proofs or give up checking fraud proofs altogether. Counterarguments included being able to get part of the proof from an onchain transaction (which requires that someone paid an onchain fee) and also that users could choose where they download fraud proofs from, preferring to get them from a source that was known for only propagating accurate information.</li></ul><h2>Notable code and documentation changes</h2><p><em>Notable changes this week in <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\">Bitcoin Core</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning\">C-Lightning</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair\">Eclair</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/\">LND</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning\">Rust-Lightning</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1\">libsecp256k1</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI\">Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI)</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin\">Rust Bitcoin</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/\">BTCPay Server</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/\">Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/\">Lightning BOLTs</a>.</em></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16546\">Bitcoin Core #16546</a> introduces a new signer interface, allowing Bitcoin Core to interact with external hardware signing devices through the <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/hwi/\">HWI</a> or any other application which implements the same interface.Bitcoin Core has been able to interface with hardware signers using HWI <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2019/05/07/#basic-hardware-signer-support-through-independent-tool\">since Bitcoin Core version 0.18</a>.

The PR includes <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/external-signer.md\">full documentation</a> on how to use the new signer interface along with HWI.The new signer interface is currently only accessible through RPC methods. A <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/4\">draft PR</a> adds support for the signer interface to the GUI, allowing the use of hardware signers with Bitcoin Core without any use of the command line.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning/issues/791\">Rust-Lightning #791</a> adds support for polling <code>BlockSource</code> interfaces on startup to sync blocks and headers, with fork detection during sync. As described in <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/02/10/#rust-lightning-774\">Newsletter #135</a>, BlockSource allows software to obtain data from sources other than a standard Bitcoin Core compatible node, allowing redundancy that can help prevent <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eclipse-attacks/\">eclipse attacks</a> or other security problems.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-lightning/issues/794\">Rust-Lightning #794</a> enables support for the <a href=\"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md\">BOLT2</a> <code>option_shutdown_anysegwit</code> feature that permits future segwit versions when initiating shutdown. If <code>option_shutdown_anysegwit</code> is negotiated, a channel party sending a shutdown message to initiate closing may send a scriptpubkey for payment, provided the script complies with the standard <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki\">BIP141</a> witness program form of a <em>version byte</em> (a 1-byte push opcode of <code>OP_1</code> through <code>OP_16</code>) followed by a <em>witness program</em> (a byte vector push of 2 to 40 bytes). These shutdown scripts are limited to standard forms to avoid expensive fee-heavy scripts or transactions with oversized scripts not propagating due to non-standardness. As it became <a href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.19.0.1/#mempool-and-transaction-relay\">possible</a> to relay payments to any segwit script in Bitcoin Core 0.19.0.1 (released November 2019), it’s now safe to <a href=\"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/issues/672\">include them</a> in LN’s standard forms.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/issues/413\">HWI #413</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/issues/469\">#469</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/issues/463\">#463</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/issues/464\">#464</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/issues/471\">#471</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/issues/468\">#468</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/issues/466\">#466</a> significantly update and extend HWI’s documentation.

Each signature’s sighash byte indicates what parts of the transaction need to be signed. Bitcoin’s consensus rules dictate that non-standard sighash values are treated as equivalent to <code>SIGHASH_ALL</code>, but the fact that they aren’t relayed or mined by default can theoretically be used to trick software using offchain commitments into accepting an unenforceable payment. Developers of such software using Rust-Bitcoin may which to switch to this new method from the <code>SigHashType::from_u32</code> method that accepts any consensus-valid sighash byte.</li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/issues/1069\">BIPs #1069</a> updates <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0008.mediawiki\">BIP8</a> to allow for a configurable activation threshold and to include 90% as a recommendation, down from 95% previously, based on the most recent <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/02/24/#taproot-activation-discussion\">taproot activation discussion</a>.</li></ul><p>Find the <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/03/03/\">original post here.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Please <a href=\"https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/\">subscribe to the Bitcoin Optech newsletter</a> directly to receive this content straight to your inbox every month.</p>","summary":"This week’s newsletter covers the BIP70 payment protocol, proposals for a standardized way to exchange fraud proofs for Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) and more.","date_published":"2021-03-04T00:00:05.000Z","author":{"name":"Bitcoin Optech"}},{"guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-fed-markets-and-inflation-with-michael-lebowitz","url":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-fed-markets-and-inflation-with-michael-lebowitz","title":"The Fed, Markets And Inflation With Michael Lebowitz","content_html":"<p class=\"subtitle\">In this episode of Bitcoin Magazine’s \"Fed Watch\" podcast, the hosts spoke with Michael Lebowitz, a portfolio manager for RIA Advisors.</p><!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/41IicdmdYIE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><p><strong>Listen To This Episode:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/fed-watch-bitcoin-and-macro/id1543640492#episodeGuid=715dae0a-49fd-415d-95b9-b6f019bfa320\">Apple</a></li><li><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/6d3grG31GxiYVcP4Ho2Fs0?si=ETbhrj5gSOWrTTci8jHDaw\">Spotify</a></li><li><a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWR3YXRjaC5saWJzeW4uY29tL3Jzcw/episode/NzE1ZGFlMGEtNDlmZC00MTVkLTk1YjktYjZmMDE5YmZhMzIw?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwjovYHv1JTvAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQBA\">Google</a></li><li><a href=\"http://fedwatch.btc.libsynpro.com/fed-markets-and-inflation-w-micheal-lebowitz-fed-43\">Libsyn</a></li><li><a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+m2acm4ml8\">Overcast</a></li></ul><p>In this episode of <em>Bitcoin Magazine</em>’s \"Fed Watch\" podcast, Christian Keroles and Ansel Lindner spoke with <u><a href=\"https://riaadvisors.com/houston/team/michael-p-lebowitz/\">Michael Lebowitz</a></u>, a portfolio manager for RIA Advisors. </p><p>This is a change of pace for \"Fed Watch,\" reaching out to forward-thinking financial advisors to ask for their industry insight on the Federal Reserve, monetary matters and bitcoin. Lebowitz has made several appearances on \"Real Vision\" and numerous other macro podcasts, and notably appears weekly on <u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/TheRealInvestmentShow\">RIA’s YouTube channel</a></u> with business partner Lance Roberts. The latter source is where Lindner discovered his content, and he was impressed with the level of insight on monetary questions.</p><p>The conversation started off with asking Lebowitz about the general situation he sees out there in investing, but with a specific slant toward the elephant in the room of bitcoin. Lebowitz has in-depth knowledge of different asset classes and portfolio construction, which arose time and again in the 30-minute conversation.</p><p>Next, Lindner turned to some of Lebowitz's <u><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/can-the-fed-both-tap-on-the-brakes-and-floor-the-gas/\">recent articles</a></u> on the Treasury General Account (TGA) and the “pent up demand” narrative. The TGA in general is an under-discussed topic, so in this episode, the participants tried to dive a little further into some of the details. In short, the U.S. Treasury has until August to reduce the TGA balance by roughly $1 trillion. This could have two interesting effects. First, that is a lot of money that must be spent into the economy and could cause prices to rise. Second, the Treasury will need to issue far less new debt in the form of new U.S. treasuries (USTs). That could put pressure on money markets, especially as the Fed is continuing to take USTs off of the market with quantitative easing. Lebowitz gave his insight on this unique confluence of forces.</p><p>Lebowitz’s <u><a href=\"https://realinvestmentadvice.com/will-go-crazy-drive-the-bear-out-of-hibernation/\">second article</a></u> of interest was on pent-up demand hitting the market this summer as people expect most of the virus restrictions to begin coming to an end at that time. He walked through some of the nuanced issues in regards to monetary and fiscal policy possibilities. We are in uncharted waters here, and Lebowitz did a good job of making the pieces fit into a narrative, but at the same time preaching caution and diversification. He leans toward deflation, with a healthy respect for inflation as he advises clients on their investments.</p><p>Lastly, this episode dove pretty deeply into broad future predictions. Of course, this involves bitcoin as a headline topic. Can the Fed do anything? Is U.S. dollar hegemony in jeopardy? Is the entire fiat financial model in jeopardy? These are the types of questions discussed. Lebowitz is not a bitcoiner, but has done a fair bit of research into bitcoin, blockchains and tokens. He is representative of financial professionals everywhere who are being forced to take a look down the bitcoin rabbit hole. He has not fallen in yet, but he and many others are going that direction.</p>","summary":"In this episode of Bitcoin Magazine’s \"Fed Watch\" podcast, the hosts spoke with Michael Lebowitz, a portfolio manager for RIA Advisors.","date_published":"2021-03-03T23:05:02.000Z","author":{"name":"Ansel Lindner"}}]}
